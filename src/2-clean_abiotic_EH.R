### Meta-analysis-BEF: Cleaning Data (Part 2) ###

# Purpose of R script is to clean raw BEF datasets for abiotic EH data
# Abiotic EH can be classified as (1) pH, (2) soil moisture, etc...

# Some notes on experimental design 
  # located	at	Ste	Anne-	de-	Bellevue,	near	Montreal,	QuÃ©bec,	Canada
  # part of the IDENT BEF experiment (seven sites in NA + Europe)
  # established	on	an	agricultural	field	in	spring,	2009
  # replicated	in	4	blocks
  # 12	mono,	14 two-spp mix, 10 four-spp	mix, +  1 mixture	with	all	twelve-spp 
  # total	of	148	plots	used	in	this	study

# Some notes on soil sampling
  # Soils	were	sampled	in	June	2012	(during	the	fourth	growing	season)
  # used	aluminum	cylindrical	corers	(8.5	cm	diameter + 	3	cm	depth)
  # two	soil	cores	were	randomly	sampled	per	plot	from	the	center	of	a	square	created	by	four	trees	and	then	were	pooled
  # fresh	soil	samples	were	sieved	at	<2	mm,	and	visible	debris were removed
  # soil	pH	was	measured	in	0.01	mol/L	CaCl2	solution	that	is	added	to	soil	in	a	1:2	soil	to	liquid	mixture

# Some notes on soil sampling
  # 1 inch PVC tubes 20 cm long with one end filed to a point 
  # first soil cores are taken and placed in a plastic sandwich bag, this is the initial sample
  # At the same time n-min tubes are placed in the ground with rubber stoppers on the tops close to where the cores were taken 
  # The soil in these tubes is collected after one month, and this is considered the final sample
  # measured pH of the samples that were taken for N min
  # soil samples put into a solution of 1M KCl 
  # the supernatant was then pipetted off the soil/KCl mixture into vials
  # the samples were then frozen until we measured pH. We take this value to be an approximation of soil pH. 
  # then thawed the samples; all pH measurements must be taken within 1 week from the day the samples were thawed
  # calibrated the pH probe using pH standards (pH4, pH7, and pH10); recalibrated after each set of 10 sample measurements 
  # If the machine was not drifting, we recalibrated after every 25 samples
  # se made sure to rinse the probe with deionized water after every measurement
