### Meta-analysis-BEF: Cleaning Data (Part 1) ###

# Purpose of R script is to clean raw BEF datasets for vegetative EH data
# Vegetative EH can be classified as (1) biomass, (2) plant density (or abundance) and (3) plant height

# Some notes on experimental design:
  # multiple sites were used 
  # randomized block design
  # plot size: 2.4 X 2.4 m
  # four replicates per treatment 

# Some notes on biomass sampling:
  # biomass sampling took place in 2015 and 2016
  # took one random 0.25 m2 section of each replicate; cut at the soil surface
  # separated by species (weeds were combined into one pool)
  # dried @ 60 C for 48hr
  # dataset used total biomass for fall and spring collection
