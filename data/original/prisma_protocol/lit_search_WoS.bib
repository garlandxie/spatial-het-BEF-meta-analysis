abstract = {The mechanisms by which plant diversity influences consumers are largely unexplored. Plant diversity reduces among-plant competition, and as a result, may have cascading bottom-up effects through altered resource quantity and quality. Less understood are parallel effects of resource heterogeneity on consumer foraging behaviors, and the consequences of such effects for trophic interactions and feedbacks on plant performance. Here, we asked whether genotypic diversity in the herb Ruellia nudiflora influences seed predator (SP) and parasitoid functional responses, and if such effects in turn influence selection on the plant. We established plots with plants of one or five genetic families (pool = 14) and measured fruit, seed predator, and parasitoid abundance. By eliminating direct plant–plant interactions, this experiment explicitly tested for plant diversity effects occurring through altered consumer behaviors (vs. effects through changes in plant quantity or quality). We compared observed plant fitness (u...},

abstract = {Planting tree species with desirable traits may catalyze forest regeneration in increasingly common degraded lands by restoring soil properties and attracting seed dispersers. We sampled forest regeneration in an experimental plantation of Albizia lebbek, an introduced N-fixing species, on a degraded pasture in northern Puerto Rico, 27. years after its establishment. We hypothesized that the abundance of animal-dispersed tree species within this unmanaged plantation would be (1) greater than in adjacent pastures; (2) higher at distances closer to secondary forest; and (3) increased over the 20. years since floristic surveys were last conducted in the site. We sampled forest structure and tree species composition, and compared the abundance of animal-dispersed tree species on plots located within the adjacent pasture and the A. lebbek plantation, within the plantation in plots distanced at 10, 35, and 60. m from secondary forest, and within the plantation at 7 vs. 27. years after plantation establishment. We found higher abundance of animal-dispersed tree species in the A. lebbek plantation than in the pasture. Distance from secondary forest had no effect on the abundance of animal-dispersed species. The abundance of animal-dispersed species increased by 14% between 7 and 27. years after plantation establishment. In all, these results indicate that A. lebbek trees facilitated the establishment of native animal-dispersed species by shading out tall grasses and acting as perches for animals throughout the plantation. We found that A. lebbek lost its dominance in the site to another introduced N-fixing species, Leucaena leucocephala, possibly due to unfavorable traits such as susceptibility to pathogens. Our findings document a transition from an experimental plantation to a novel urban forest that harbors an array of native tree species, largely due to the dispersal of seeds by animals. A noteworthy example is the presence of Guaiacum officinale, an animal-dispersed and endangered tree species native to the dry forests of southern Puerto Rico. Our results highlight how monocultures of introduced tree species with desirable traits can catalyze the regeneration of native tree species in chronically degraded lands.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that biological structures such as plant roots can have large impacts on landscape morphodynamics, and that physical models that do not incorporate biology can generate qualitatively incorrect predictions of sediment transport. However, work to date has focused almost entirely on the impacts of single, usually dominant, species. Here we ask whether multiple, coexisting species of hydropsychid caddisfly larvae have different impacts on sediment mobility compared to single-species systems due to competitive interactions and niche differences. We manipulated the presence of two common species of net-spinning caddisfly (Ceratopsyche oslari, Arctopsyche californica) in laboratory mesocosms and measured how their silk filtration nets influence the critical shear stress required to initiate sediment grain motion when they were in monoculture versus polyculture. We found that critical shear stress increases non-additively in polycultures where species were allowed to interact. Critical shear stress was 26% higher in multi-species assemblages compared to the average single-species monoculture, and 21% greater than levels of stability achieved by the species having the largest impact on sediment motion in monoculture. Supplementary behavioral experiments suggest the non-additive increase in critical shear stress may have occurred as competition among species led to shifts in the spatial distribution of the two populations and complementary habitat use. To explore the implications of these results for field conditions, we used results from the laboratory study to parameterize a common model of sediment transport. We then used this model to estimate potential bed movement in a natural stream for which we had measurements of channel geometry, grain size, and daily discharge. Although this extrapolation is speculative, it illustrates that multi-species impacts could be sufficiently large to reduce bedload sediment flux over annual time scales in streams where multiple species of caddisfly are present.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

Spore abundance, morphotype richness and extramatrical hyphal lengths were all greater in monoculture plots. A structural equation model showed AM fungal biovolume was most influenced by CO(2) enrichment, plant community composition and plant richness, whereas spore richness was most influenced by fungal biovolume, plant community composition and plant richness. • Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi responded to differences in host community and resource availability, suggesting that mycorrhizal functions, such as carbon sequestration and soil stability, will be affected by global change.},

abstract = {The importance of herbivores and of plant diversity for community succession and recovery from disturbance is well documented. However, few studies have assessed the relative magnitude of, or potential interactions between, these factors. To determine the combined effect of herbivory and surrounding algal species richness on the recovery of a rocky intertidal community, we conducted a 27-month field experiment assessing algal recruitment and succession in cleared patches that mimic naturally forming gaps in the ambient community. We crossed two herbivore treatments, ambient and reduced abundance, with monocultures and polycultures of the four most common algal species in a mid-high rocky intertidal zone of northern California. We found that both the presence of herbivores and high surrounding algal richness increased recovery rates, and the effect of algal richness was twice the magnitude of that of herbivores. The increased recovery rate of patches containing herbivores was due to the consumption of fast-growing, early colonist species that preempt space from perennial, late-successional species. Mechanisms linking algal richness and recovery are more numerous. In polycultures, herbivore abundance and species composition is altered, desiccation rates are lower, and propagule recruitment, survival, and growth are higher compared to monocultures, all of which could contribute the observed effect of surrounding species richness. Herbivory and species richness should jointly accelerate recovery wherever palatable species inhibit late-successional, herbivore-resistant species and recruitment and survival of new colonists is promoted by local species richness. These appear to be common features of rocky-shore seaweed, and perhaps other, communities.},

Was evaluated the luminosity, temperature and relative humidity, leaf nutrient concentrations; internodes of the plagiotropic and orthotropic branches, leaf area; relative chlorophyll index, and tree yield of the coffee crops. The shading directly influenced the microclimate by reducing the air temperature in the summer and winter, as well as by increasing relative humidity. Luminosity in the summer had an average decrease of 905 lumens ft-2 throughout the day, which was equivalent to 72.49%, and luminosity in the winter had an average decrease of 1665 lumens ft-2, which was equivalent to 88.04%. The shading provided greater etiolation of the plagiotropic and orthotropic branches as well as greater leaf expansion as compared to the full sun. The leaf concentration of Fe and Mn were higher in the shaded coffee. Estimated chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were greater in the coffee crop grown at under full sun. The dense shading produced by rubber trees provided losses in the coffee crop yield, however, there is the formation of the rubber tree.},

abstract = {The global demand for cacao has recently increased. To meet this demand, the cultivated area has been expanded in tropical forest areas and production has intensified by replacing traditional agroforestry systems with monocultures. This has led to a loss of biodiversity in cacao-growing areas. More sustainable production systems such as agroforestry and organic managed systems are expected to yield less cacao, but by-crops and premium prices, respectively, might economically compensate for the lower yields. Here, we compared the productivity and the return on labor, that is the return per working day, of four different cacao production systems: agroforestry and monocultures under organic and conventional management. Cacao and by-crop yields, costs, revenues, and labor were registered during the first 5 years after establishment. Results show that cacao yields were, on average, 41% higher in monocultures, but the revenues derived from agroforestry by-crops economically overcompensated for this difference. Indeed, the return on labor across the years was roughly twice as high in the agroforestry systems compared to the monocultures. We found similar cacao yields and return on labor in conventional and organically managed agroforestry systems. However, in the monocultures, cacao yields were 48% lower under organic compared with conventional farming, but the return on labor was similar, mainly due to the higher costs associated to the conventional management. Overall, our findings show that cacao agroforestry systems have higher return on labor.},

The present experiment evaluates the effect of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Weber) as a potential pasture species on the performance of a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)-white clover (Trifolium repens L.) mixture in terms of total herbage yield, weed infestation, and nitrogen (N) yield in a replacement-series experiment over three harvest years. The three species were grown in monocultures and in all possible binary and three-species mixtures under two N fertilization levels (0 and 200 kg N ha(-1)). Herbage yield and N yield of the three-species mixture were not significantly different from the ryegrass-white clover mixture over the 3 yr. The contribution of dandelion to the total herbage yield increased over years, which improved yield stability. A competition analysis, performed by calculating relative yield and relative yield total, indicated that ryegrass had a competitive advantage over white clover in fertilized and unfertilized swards, but over dandelion only when the sward was fertilized. Nitrogen application reduced the nonsown species yield in all mixtures, except that of white clover-dandelion. Our results indicate that dandelion might have the potential of contributing to herbage yield, nutritive value, and resistance to invasions of ryegrass-white clover pastures.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to optimize storage conditions of a microbial community used for degradation of petroleum-derived environmental contaminants. Microorganisms were either freeze-dried or directly frozen (-20°C) in the presence of four stabilizers: trehalose, sucrose, glycerol and DMSO. It was found that preincubation with trehalose and sucrose had a positive impact on cell viability for both tested storage techniques. Disaccharide-stabilized consortia were more biodiverse than control samples (untreated with any protectants) and they retained high xenobiotic biodegradation capabilities. The effect of glycerol and DMSO was unexpectedly poor, contradicting other findings on the protective action of these compounds on monocultures. Higher cell survival was achieved only upon short-term (7 days) freezing, whereas DMSO proved to be lethal in the case of freeze-dried communities. Taking into account practical and economic reasons, the use of sucrose rather than the more expensive trehalose appears as the most efficient method for microbial consortia biostabilization during long-term storage. The experimental work provides some important data concerning the problem of elaboration of improved methods for preserving robust microbial communities to be used in environmental biotechnology practice.},

Litter-mixing studies have examined whether the diversity and heterogeneity of litter inputs affect decomposer communities in ways that can be predicted from monocultures. They have mainly attempted to detect non-additive effects of litter mixing, although individual species effects (additivity) as well as species interactions (non-additivity) may alter decomposition rates. To determine potential impacts of plant species loss on aboveground-decomposer linkages, we assessed both additive and non-additive effects of litter mixing on decomposer communities. A full-factorial litterbag experiment with leaves from four deciduous tree species was conducted, to assess responses of bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and microarthropods. Data were analyzed using a statistical method that first looked for additive effects based on the presence or absence of species and then any significant species interactions. We observed almost exclusively additive effects of all four litter species on decomposer biota, with each species exerting effects on different aspects of the community. These results imply that the consequences of species loss for the decomposer community will be largely predictable from knowledge of single species litter dynamics. The two species at opposite ends of the quality spectrum exerted the most effects. High-quality Liriodendron tulipifera supported a more diverse arthropod community and drove bottom-up effects on the decomposer food web. Low-quality Rhododendron maximum had negative effects on most groups of biota. Litter of mid-quality species exerted fewer effects. The influence of litter species richness on the Tylenchidae (nematodes) was the only non-additive effect of litter mixing. Together, these data demonstrate an effect of plant community composition on decomposer biomass, abundance, and diversity, confirming a link between above and belowground communities. We were able to identify the species to which the decomposer community is most sensitive, aiding predictions of the consequences of the loss of these dominant species on the decomposer community, with potential feedbacks for organic matter and nutrient turnover. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many studies have investigated the influence of plant litter species composition on decomposition, but results have been context-dependent. Litter and soil are considered to constitute a decomposition continuum, but whether litter and soil ecosystems respond to litter identity and mixing in the same manner is unsure. In a field experiment utilizing 5 litter species and their mixture, we investigated whether the effects of litter identity and mixing on mass loss, nutrient dynamics, and decomposer communities are consistent across the litter-soil interface. In monoculture, mass loss and nitrogen (N) dynamics in the litter layer corresponded to the underlying soil N availability, demonstrating the continuum of resources from litter to soil. Litter microbial biomass and mesofauna abundance tended to be greater on litter with a faster decay rate and greater N release. However, soil decomposer abundance and diversity were not greater with higher soil N, causing litter and soil communities to respond differently to litter identity. Non-additive mass loss and N dynamics were observed after 6 months, and were correlated with non-additive litter microbial community composition and litter mesofauna communities, but all other aspects of the litter community and all measures of the soil community were additive. Decomposer communities and N dynamics did not respond similarly to the litter mixture across the litter-soil interface. This study is one of the few to comprehensively examine how a litter mixture influences decomposition dynamics and communities across the soil-litter interface, including multiple taxa and trophic levels. Our results demonstrate that processes associated with decomposition are decoupled for litter and soil, particularly in that litter showed non-additivity in mass loss, N release and decomposer community, but soil responses were largely additive. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. Although litter decomposition is a fundamental ecological process, most of our understanding comes from studies of single-species decay. Recently, litter-mixing studies have tested whether monoculture data can be applied to mixed-litter systems. These studies have mainly attempted to detect non-additive effects of litter mixing, which address potential consequences of random species loss – the focus is not on which species are lost, but the decline in diversity per se . 2. Under global change, species loss is likely to be non-random, with some species more vulnerable to extinction than others. Under such scenarios, the effects of individual species (additivity) as well as of species interactions (non-additivity) on decomposition rates are of interest. 3. To examine potential impacts of non-random species loss on ecosystems, we studied additive and non-additive effects of litter mixing on decomposition. A full-factorial litterbag experiment was conducted using four deciduous leaf species, from which mass loss and nitrogen content were measured. Data were analysed using a statistical approach that first looks for additive identity effects based on the presence or absence of species and then significant species interactions occurring beyond those. It partitions non-additive effects into those caused by richness and/or composition. 4. This approach addresses questions key to understanding the potential effects of species loss on ecosystem processes. If additive effects dominate, the consequences for decomposition dynamics will be predictable based on our knowledge of individual species, but not statistically predictable if non-additive effects dominate. 5. We found additive (identity) effects on mass loss and non-additive (composition) effects on litter nitrogen dynamics, suggesting that non-random species loss could significantly affect this system. We were able to identify the species responsible for effects that would otherwise have been considered idiosyncratic or absent when analysed by the methods used in previous work. 6. Synthesis . We observed both additive and non-additive effects of litter-mixing on decomposition, indicating consequences of non-random species loss. To predict the consequences of global change for ecosystem functioning, studies should examine the effects of both random and non-random species loss, which will help identify the mechanisms that influence the response of ecosystems to environmental change.},

abstract = {Monocultures typical of intensive agriculture offer ideal conditions to specialized herbivores while depriving their natural enemies of habitat and nutritional resources. The resulting release of herbivores from both bottom-up and top-down control causes pest outbreaks in economically important crops. Boosting locally occurring natural enemy populations through species-specific habitat management to restore natural herbivore control has been much advocated but remains rarely tested in the field. Here, we investigated whether adding specifically selected flowering plants to monocultures increases parasitation rates of herbivores and crop yield. We performed replicated field experiments in 2. years and found that adding cornflowers (Centaurea cyanus) into cabbage (Brassica oleracea) fields significantly increased larval and egg parasitation and egg predation of the herbivore, reduced herbivory rates, and increased crop biomass in at least 1. year. These findings show that addition of a single, well-chosen flowering plant species can significantly increase natural top-down pest control in monocultures but success is variable. This is relevant on two applied levels. First, well chosen companion plants may partially substitute pesticides in agriculture if the approach is optimized, reducing negative effects such as unspecific killing of non-target organisms, residues in food, contamination of soils and water-bodies and increasing pesticide resistances. Our results suggest that, from an agro-economical point of view, egg parasitoids or predators may be the best targets for habitat management because strong natural selection acts on larval parasitoids to keep their hosts alive for their own development. Second, the addition of non-crop vegetation to monocultures benefits biodiversity conservation directly through resource diversification and indirectly through the reduction of pesticide application that increased natural control makes possible. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {Grasslands provide numerous ecosystem services but their sustainability is threatened by climate change. As plant functional diversity is expected to stabilize ecosystem functions, we tested whether mixing species with contrasting root systems could improve the resilience of Mediterranean grasslands under increasing aridity. We hypothesized that root functional identity (RFI) and diversity (RFD) respectively determines and improves soil water uptake capacity, aboveground biomass (AGB) production and resilience after drought stress (=post-stress AGB/pre-stress AGB). Monocultures, two- and three species mixtures of two groups of perennial grasses (cultivars and native species) were compared in a twin 3-years field experiment under two levels of summer drought in southern France. RFI and RFD were assessed as the mean and variance of multiple root traits (rooting depth, deep root mass fraction, root tissue density, root diameter and specific root length) measured in species monocultures. AGB and resilience were assessed from annual harvests; total transpirable soil water (TTSW) and evapotranspiration in summer (ET_sum) were assessed through the monitoring of soil water content. For both groups of species, RFI was a major predictor of TTSW and resilience, but not of AGB or ET_sum. Greater water uptake, especially from deep soil layers, increased resilience. Rooting depth distribution determined the potential depth of water uptake while root morphology influenced the precision of water uptake along the soil profile. However, RFD only marginally improved AGB production and resilience, although long-term effects of RFD should be tested. Designing artificial plant communities under water-limited conditions should therefore prioritize the maximization of rooting depth and root distribution along the soil profile. Diversifying root morphological traits associated with resource acquisition could also have a positive impact. The similarity of results between cultivars and native species suggests that agro-ecological guidelines for species assembly can be based on advances of functional ecology in natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {The influence of plant diversity on belowground ecosystem processes and feedbacks of the latter on plant growth are still largely unexplored. A previous field experiment showed positive effects of plant diversity on diversity and activity of culturable soil bacteria. We examined soil carry-over effects of these experimental communities on subsequent plant growth and the development of soil microbial communities in pots. We inoculated sterile substrate with soil from the field experiment and then sowed three plant species - Dactylis glomerata, Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium pratense - as monocultures or 3-species mixtures into the pots. We measured the phytometers over a period of 14 months. Thereafter, we sampled the soil in 3-species mixtures to analyze microbial communities. The original plant species richness and number of functional groups had positive soil carry-over effects on phytometer germination. Furthermore, in mixtures, species richness also stimulated short-term biomass production of phytometers and catabolic diversity of culturable soil bacteria. The number of plant functional groups had a positive effect on the amount of prokaryotic phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) but negative effects on the amount of eukaryotic PLFAs and the activity of culturable soil bacteria. The carry-over effects of plant diversity on phytometer growth disappeared with time. However, specific effects of the presence of particular functional groups or species in the original plant communities remained significant and were sometimes paralleled by effects on soil microbial communities. These results suggest that in the short term, soil carry-over effects of plant diversity are mediated by a general stimulation of soil microbes whereas the longer-term effects of particular plant species are more likely due to compositional shifts in soil microbial communities. Although the mechanisms of soil carry-over effects in biodiversity experiments remain to be determined, our study demonstrates that they exist and probably involve soil microbial communities. This 'memory' of soils may be an important factor in ecosystem development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent empirical studies have found evidence of increased biomass production ('overyielding') in species mixtures relative to monoculture, but the interpretation of these results remains controversial, in part, because of the lack of a theoretical expectation. Here, we examined the expected frequency and stability of overyielding species mixtures using Lotka-Volterra models of species dynamics in two- and four-species systems in conjunction with community, population, and specific rate of biomass production (SRP) definitions of overyielding. Overyielding plant mixtures represented > 55% of potential species assemblages under community definitions and approximately 100% of species were either overyielding or underyielding under the population definition. Our species simulations approached their equilibria in 1-2 yr, supporting the relevancy of an equilibrial analysis. The range of parameter space that we explored produced realistic values of plot biomass, supporting their biological relevance. We show that overyielding is expected to be common under community definitions and population definitions. Overyielding, under community or population definitions, does not imply an actual increase in the specific rate of biomass production. In addition, assemblages of overyielding and underyielding species under all three definitions can be stable over time with underyielding species persisting in the presence of overyielding species.},

We separated the observed diversity effects on carbon uptake into those caused by species with particularly important traits (selection effect) and those caused by positive interactions among species (e.g., complementary resource use or facilitation [complementarity effect]). Additionally, we measured the composition of photosynthetically active pigments and light absorbance in communities and monocultures, and related them to species and functional diversity effects on carbon accrual. Biodiversity effects were weak or even absent in pure cyanobacterial and diatom communities compared to strong effects in chlorophytes. Complementarity effects and light absorbance increased as functional (i.e., phylogenetic) diversity increased. There was a positive correlation between complementarity effects on carbon accrual and light absorbance. These findings support hypotheses regarding biodiversity-productivity relationships in phytoplankton communities based on niche separation along spectral light gradients.},

abstract = {Declines in species diversity resulting from anthropogenic alterations of the environment heighten the need to develop management strategies that conserve species and ecosystem services. This study examined how native plant species and their diversity influence the abundance and richness of beneficial arthropods, a functionally important group that provides ecosystem services such as pollination and natural pest suppression. Beneficial arthropods were sampled in replicated study plots containing native perennials planted in one-, two-, and seven-species mixtures. We found plant diversity had a positive impact on arthropod richness but not on arthropod abundance. An analysis of arthropod community composition revealed that each flower species attracted a different assemblage of beneficial arthropods. In addition, the full seven-species mixture also attracted a distinct arthropod community compared to single-species monocultures. Using a multivariate approach, we determined whether arthropod assemblages in two- and seven-species plots were additive and could be predicted based on assemblages from their component single-species plots. On average, assemblages in diverse plots were nonadditive when compared to assemblages predicted using single-species plots. Arthropod assemblages in two-species plots most closely resembled those of only one of the flower species in the mixture. However, the arthropod assemblages in seven-species plots, although statistically deviating from the expectation of an additive model, more closely resembled predicted communities compared to the assemblages found in two-species plots, suggesting that variability in arthropod community composition decreased as planting diversity increased. Our study demonstrates that careful selection of plants in managed landscapes can augment beneficial arthropod richness and support a more predictable arthropod community, suggesting that planning and design efforts could shape arthropod assemblages in natural as well as managed landscapes to meet targeted conservation or management goals.},

abstract = {Conventional wisdom suggests that soil water lost through transpiration by weeds can intensify crop drought stress, and that this is an important mechanism by which weed competition decreases yields and crop water productivity (CWP). To assess the impact of weed competition on soil water uptake and crop drought stress, a 3-year field experiment was conducted with maize (Zea mays L.) grown in monoculture and in combination with high-density stands of three troublesome weed species (Setaria faberi Herrm., Abutilon theophrasti Medic., and Amaranthus retroflexus L.). Independent of weed species type, when canopy light interception was largely unchanged by the presence of weeds, maize-weed mixtures did not deplete more soil water than maize grown in monoculture. Conversely, when early weed growth was vigorous, maize-weed mixtures intercepted more light early in the growing season and this resulted in higher initial rates of water depletion and drier soils. In both cases, measurements of stomatal conductance suggested that the internal water status of the maize was not significantly impacted by the presence of weeds as the soil dried. CWP was influenced by weed competition and in the most extreme case declined by almost 50% relative to monoculture maize (2.6kgm-3vs. 5.0kgm-3). However, the impact of weeds on CWP was not uniform. Under low yield loss scenarios (ca. 10%), weeds had little impact on the soil water balance and CWP did not markedly decline relative to monoculture maize. Our results suggest that if weeds do not increase canopy light interception and are subordinate to lower parts of the canopy, high-density infestations can be retained in the field without increasing the probability of drought or substantially reducing CWP. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Annual N uptake into above- and belowground organs and soil nitrate pools were measured in the Jena experiment on a floodplain soil with mixtures of 2-16 species and 1-4 functional groups, and monocultures. In mixtures, the deviation of measured data from data expected from monoculture performance was calculated to assess the contribution of complementarity/facilitation and selection. N uptake varied from < 1 to 45 g N m(-2) yr(-1), and was higher in grasslands with than without legumes. On average, N uptake was higher in mixtures (21 +/- 1 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) than monocultures (13 +/- 1 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), and increased with species richness in mixtures. However, compared to N uptake expected from biomass proportions of species in mixtures, N uptake of mixtures was only slightly higher and a significant surplus N uptake was confined to mixtures containing legumes and non-legumes. In our study, high N uptake of species rich mixtures was mainly due to dominance of productive species and facilitation by legumes whereas complementarity among non-legumes was of minor relevance.},

abstract = {1. Many studies document high levels of functional redundancy in ecosystems, suggesting that species extinctions will not be detrimental to ecosystem functions and services. However, apparently redundant taxa may prove critical for sustaining ecosystem functions and services in the context of environmental perturbations. 2. Dung beetles (Coleoptera:Scarabaeidae) provide a valuable ecosystem service in temperate agro-ecosystems by increasing rates of dung decomposition and nutrient cycling. However, there is concern that these services may be negatively affected by changes in species richness and composition due to changes in pasture management and negative effects of anthelmintics used to control livestock parasites. 3. We used a mesocosm experiment to investigate the functional importance of dung beetle species richness in a system perturbed by the anthelmintic, ivermectin. We varied dung beetle species richness within three functional groups in factorial combination with ivermectin treat- ment. 4. In the short term (1–4 weeks), multi-species dung beetle assemblages achieved higher decomposition rates than monocultures, but only in ivermectin-treated dung. Varying species- specific sensitivities to ivermectin meant that species-rich assemblages sustained ecosystem functioning in the context of this anthropogenic perturbation. 5. Over the longer term (36 weeks), there was a significant, positive effect of species richness on dung decomposition in both ivermectin-treated and untreated dung, underlining the func- tional importance of maintaining a species-rich dung processing community even in the absence of perturbations to the system. 6. Synthesis and applications. The interacting effects of dung beetle species richness and ivermectin highlight the importance of maintaining diverse assemblages in the face of anthro- pogenic perturbations and suggest that apparent functional redundancy of species in agro- ecosystems should be interpreted cautiously. Furthermore, different farm management practices (e.g. pesticide use and fragmentation of habitats) may have consequences for ecosys- tem functions and services that exceed the effects of each when considered in isolation.},

abstract = {1 Plant species differ in their capacity to influence soil organic matter, soil nutrient availability and the composition of soil microbial communities. Their influences on soil properties result in net positive or negative feedback effects, which influence plant performance and plant community composition. 2 For two grassland systems, one on a sandy soil in the Netherlands and one on a chalk soil in the United Kingdom, we investigated how individual plant species grown in monocultures changed abiotic and biotic soil conditions. Then, we determined feedback effects of these soils to plants of the same or different species. Feedback effects were analysed at the level of plant species and plant taxonomic groups (grasses vs. forbs). 3 In the sandy soils, plant species differed in their effects on soil chemical properties, in particular potassium levels, but PLFA (phospholipid fatty acid) signatures of the soil microbial community did not differ between plant species. The effects of soil chemical properties were even greater when grasses and forbs were compared, especially because potassium levels were lower in grass monocultures. 4 In the chalk soil, there were no effects of plant species on soil chemical properties, but PLFA profiles differed significantly between soils from different monocultures. PLFA profiles differed between species, rather than between grasses and forbs. 5 In the feedback experiment, all plant species in sandy soils grew less vigorously in soils conditioned by grasses than in soils conditioned by forbs. These effects correlated significantly with soil chemical properties. None of the seven plant species showed significant differences between performance in soil conditioned by the same vs. other plant species. 6 In the chalk soil, Sanguisorba minor and in particular Briza media performed best in soil collected from conspecifics, while Bromus erectus performed best in soil from heterospecifics. There was no distinctive pattern between soils collected from forb and grass monocultures, and plant performance could not be related to soil chemical properties or PLFA signatures. 7 Our study shows that mechanisms of plant-soil feedback can depend on plant species, plant taxonomic (or functional) groups and site-specific differences in abiotic and biotic soil properties. Understanding how plant species can influence their rhizosphere, and how other plant species respond to these changes, will greatly enhance our understanding of the functioning and stability of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Rhizosphere soils from 12 different plant species grown as monocultures at a field site of biodiversity and ecological processes in terrestrial herbaceous ecosystems (BIODEPTH) in northern Sweden were used as inoculum on potato to investigate mycorrhizal traits. Potato roots showed significantly higher mycorrhizal colonization when inoculated with soil samples from Festuca ovina and Leucanthemum vulgare compared to soil samples from other plants. The soil samples of F. ovina, L. vulgare, Phalaris arundinacea and Trifolium pratense rhizospheres were chosen for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi identification based on spore morphology and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA sequences amplified from single spores and roots. Spore morphological identification showed that Glomus mosseae and Glomus intraradices were found in F. ovina and L. vulgare soils at the site as well as in our potato trap experiment. Also, Glomus geosporum spores were present in all four plants' soils in the potato trap experiment. LSU rDNA sequences were obtained from AM fungal spores from the collection site or potato trap experiment and colonized potato roots inoculated with L. vulgare soil. Sequences showed highest similarity to G. mosseae. Our results suggest that the host F. ovina and L. vulgare could be considered in crop rotation to enhance AM fungal inocula for potatoes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Food webs of many ecosystems are sustained by organic matter from other habitats. Human activities and climatic change are increasingly modifying the quality and supply of these resources, yet for most ecosystems it is unknown how the taxonomic composition of organic matter influences community composition. Along the coastline of Sydney, Australia, the once abundant habitat-forming macroalga, Phyllospora comosa, is now locally extinct. Shallow reefs are now primarily occupied by Sargassum sp. and, to a lesser extent, the kelp Ecklonia radiata. We experimentally manipulated the supply of P. comosa, Sargassum sp. and E. radiata to estuarine sediments to assess responses by macroinvertebrate communities to: (1) changing the identity of the dominant detrital resource; and (2) varying the ratio of input of different macrophytes. Estuarine sediments dosed with P. comosa supported greater abundances of macroinvertebrates than sediments receiving Sargassum sp. or the kelp E. radiata. Whereas plots receiving Sargassum sp. or E. radiata had fewer macroinvertebrates than controls, plots receiving a moderate (120 g dry weight per m(2)) loading of P. comosa had more. Mixtures of detritus dominated by P. comosa supported similar macroinvertebrate communities to monocultures of the alga. Communities in sediments receiving detritus comprised of less than one-third P. comosa were, however, distinctly different. Our study provides evidence that the ecological ramifications of species decline can extend to spatially removed ecosystems, subsidised by allochthonous materials. Even prior to extinction of detrital sources, small changes in their provision of organic matter may alter the structure of subsidised communities.},

abstract = {Cover crop mixtures with complementary plant functional traits including biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) may supply nitrogen (N) to farm fields while simultaneously providing other ecosystem functions such as N retention and weed suppression (i.e., multifunctionality). Understanding variation in these relationships across farms can help advance trait-based research in agroecology and ecological approaches to nutrient management. This on-farm experiment explored the contributions of two- and three-species cover crop mixtures, which combined legumes, brassicas and cool season grasses, to ecosystem functions across a gradient of soil fertility levels driven by farm management history. I evaluated the predictions that functional trait diversity of the cover crops would explain variation in multifunctionality, and that legume biomass and BNF within mixtures would be inversely correlated with indicators of soil N availability from organic matter across the farm gradient. Ecosystem functions varied widely across farms. As expected, functional diversity was a significant predictor of multifunctionality, although the relationship was weak. Cover crop mixtures had significantly greater multifunctionality than a cereal rye monoculture, though not at the highest observed levels of each function, indicating trade-offs among functions. Linear regression models showed that legume biomass and BNF were negatively correlated with soil properties indicative of N availability from soil organic matter, whereas non-legume and weed biomass were positively correlated with other measures of soil fertility. Synthesis and applications. Cover crop mixtures can increase functional diversity within crop rotations. Designing mixtures with complementary plant traits may be particularly effective for increasing multifunctionality and agroecosystem sustainability. On-farm research to understand variation in biological nitrogen fixation, which is both a plant trait and a key ecosystem function, across heterogeneous soil conditions, can inform management of soil fertility based on ecological principles.},

abstract = {Plant species identity and diversity may greatly influence the composition of the nematode fauna. In this study the development of the nematode fauna was followed in a field experiment on arable soil with monocultures and mixtures of several plant species. Experimental plots were sown with one, four or 12 species of grass, legumes and forbs and were sampled four times in 7 years. Nematode diversity was little influenced by plant diversity. Due to a pronounced increase of Paratylenchus projectus populations, the Shannon diversity index decreased in several treatments towards the end of the experiment. Differences in nematode faunal composition among treatments increased with time. In spite of the rather long duration of the experiment, the faunal composition did not stabilise but changed continuously. The obligate plant feeders Tylenchorhynchus dubius, T. maximus and Pratylenchus spp. occurred in higher numbers in monocultures than in mixtures of several plant species. Among the microbivores, the abundance of some bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematode taxa seemed to be directly influenced by the plant species identity. In the plots with Trifolium spp. there was an increase of rapidly growing bacterial feeders belonging to Rhabditidae and Panagrolaimidae already after the first growing season. The abundances of some bacterial-feeding nematodes were correlated to total plant production. The numbers of the omnivorous Mesodorylaimus sp. appeared to be influenced by the degree of plant coverage. The abundance of several nematode taxa appeared to be little influenced by the composition of the vegetation. The plant feeder P. projectus and the bacterial feeder Prismatolaimus sp. reacted rather slowly and a distinct increase in numbers was only seen after 7 years, when P. projectus strongly dominated the fauna in several treatments. Among the bacterial feeders, some species with moderate growth rate belonging to Cephalobidae decreased with time in several treatments.},

abstract = {Most studies evaluating the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning are conducted at a single location, limiting our understanding of how diversity–function relationships may change when measured across different spatial scales. We conducted a species-removal experiment at three sites nested in each of three regions along the rocky intertidal coastline of the Gulf of Maine, USA, to evaluate the potential for scale-dependent effects of species loss on the biomass of intertidal seaweed assemblages. We randomly assigned 50 plots in the mid-intertidal zone at each site to one of five treatments (n = 10 plots each): an unmanipulated control, a polyculture plot that contained our three target seaweed species, and three monoculture plots. We manipulated diversity by removing all non-target species from monoculture and polyculture plots, then removing additional biomass from polyculture plots, proportionate to species' relative abundances, so that the average amount removed from monoculture and polyculture plots was equivalent at each site. At the largest spatial scale, all sites considered together, after accounting for region and site nested within region seaweed diversity had consistent, positive effects on seaweed cover. Diverse polyculture plots always had higher cover than was predicted by the average performance of the component seaweed species and usually had higher cover than even the best-performing component species. Diversity effects weakened and became less consistent at smaller spatial scales, so that at the scale of individual sites, diverse polycultures only performed better than the average of monocultures $\sim$40% of the time. Hence, our results indicate that weak and/or inconsistent biodiversity effects at the level of individual sites may scale up to stronger, more consistent effects at larger spatial scales. Quantitative summaries of biodiversity experiments conducted at the scale of individual sites do not capture this spatial aspect of biodiversity effects and may therefore underestimate the functional consequences of biodiversity loss.},

abstract = {Aim of study: We aim at (i) developing a reference definition of mixed forests in order to harmonize comparative research in mixed forests and (ii) briefly review the research perspectives in mixed forests. Area of study: The definition is developed in Europe but can be tested worldwide. Material and methods: Review of existent definitions of mixed forests based and literature review encompassing dynamics, management and economic valuation of mixed forests. Main results: A mixed forest is defined as a forest unit, excluding linear formations, where at least two tree species coexist at any developmental stage, sharing common resources (light, water, and/or soil nutrients). The presence of each of the component species is normally quantified as a proportion of the number of stems or of basal area, although volume, biomass or canopy cover as well as proportions by occupied stand area may be used for specific objectives. A variety of structures and patterns of mixtures can occur, and the interactions between the component species and their relative proportions may change over time. The research perspectives identified are (i) species interactions and responses to hazards, (ii) the concept of maximum density in mixed forests, (iii) conversion of monocultures to mixed-species forest and (iv) economic valuation of ecosystem services provided by mixed forests. Research highlights: The definition is considered a high-level one which encompasses previous attempts to define mixed forests. Current fields of research indicate that gradient studies, experimental design approaches, and model simulations are key topics providing new research opportunities.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that encourage or inhibit plant invasions is vital to focusing limited invasive control efforts within areas where they are most practical and cost-effective. To extend the range of contexts in which invasibility is studied and aid the development of practical strategies to limit damaging plant invasions, we set out to test the relative importance of native species richness, native seedling density, and invasive propagule pressure, on the invasibility of artificial assemblages of naturally occurring tropical woody seedling communities. Our greenhouse mesocosms included a species pool of twelve trees and woody shrubs native to South Florida's tropical hardwood hammocks, and an increasingly prevalent noxious woody invader of this system, Ardisia elliptica. We found that invader propagule pressure was the single most important factor determining community invasibility. We also revealed a positive relationship between invasibility and native species richness in our polyculture mesocosms. Because A. elliptica biomass production significantly differed among different native monocultures and was not related to overyielding in native polycultures, we suggest that the effect of species richness on invasibility in this experiment was the result of sampling effects rather than a true effect of diversity.Three broad findings hold potential for application in preventing and controlling plant invasions, especially in the seedling layers of tropical dry forests: (1) effective invasive control efforts will likely benefit from measures to minimize propagule pressure; (2) managers might do well to prioritize invasive monitoring and removal efforts on the most diverse habitats within a management region; and (3) while more data are necessary to further understand our finding of a lack of association between productivity and invasibility, management regimes aimed at maximizing primary productivity might not increase invasibility, and in fact, strategies for controlling invasive plants via the management of ecosystem productivity may be ineffective. {\textcopyright} 2013 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

abstract = {A common goal of conservation biological control is to enhance biodiversity and increase abundance and effectiveness of predators and parasitoids. Although many studies report an increase in abundance of natural enemies, it has been difficult to document increases in rates of biological control. To enhance parasitism of the tufted apple bud moth, Platynota idaeusalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), alternate food was provided by interplanting peaches bearing extrafloral nectaries into apple (Malus spp.) orchards. Laboratory studies showed that the presence of nectar increased longevity and parasitism rates by Goniozus floridanus (Bethylidae), the dominant parasitoid of tufted apple bud moth in West Virginia. In orchard studies, we found the total number of hymenopteran parasitoids was higher on peach (Prunus spp.) trees than on adjacent apple trees. Abundance of parasitic Hymenoptera also was significantly higher on the side of traps facing away from rather than toward peach trees, indicating attraction to peach trees. However, total parasitism rates of tufted apple bud moth were not affected by the presence of peach extrafloral nectar in any field studies. Insect injury to fruit at harvest showed that fruit from orchards with interplanted peach trees had less injury from San Jose scale, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus (Comstock) and stink bugs (Pentatomidae) than fruit from an apple monoculture. Although interplanting with peach trees did not produce the hypothesized result of increased biological control, the experiment did have beneficial results for pest management. These results demonstrate the importance of collecting data on variables beyond the targeted species when evaluating habitat manipulation experiments to fully assess the impact on the ecosystem.},

We conducted a series of field and mesocosm experiments to measure the relative effects of macroalgal identity and richness on primary productivity (net photosynthetic rate) and biomass accumulation in hard substratum subtidal communities in North Carolina, USA. Algal identity consistently and strongly affected production; species richness effects, although often significent, were subtle. Partitioning of the net biodiversity effect indicated that complementarity effects were always positive and species were usually more productive in mixtures than in monoculture. Surprisingly, slow growing species performed relatively better in the most diverse treatments than the most productive species, thus selection effects were consistently negative. Our results suggest that several basic mechanisms underlying terrestrial plant biodiversity effects also operate in algal-based marine ecosystems, and thus may be general.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of community coexistence and ecosystem functioning may help to counteract the current biodiversity loss and its potentially harmful consequences. In recent years, plant-soil feedback that can, for example, be caused by below-ground microorganisms has been suggested to play a role in maintaining plant coexistence and to be a potential driver of the positive relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning. Most of the studies addressing these topics have focused on the species level. However, in addition to interspecific interactions, intraspecific interactions might be important for the structure of natural communities. Here, we examine intraspecific coexistence and intraspecific diversity effects using 10 natural accessions of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. We assessed morphological intraspecific diversity by measuring several above- and below-ground traits. We performed a plant-soil feedback experiment that was based on these trait differences between the accessions in order to determine whether A. thaliana experiences feedback at intraspecific level as a result of trait differences. We also experimentally tested the diversity-productivity relationship at intraspecific level. We found strong differences in above- and below-ground traits between the A. thaliana accessions. Overall, plant-soil feedback occurred at intraspecific level. However, accessions differed in the direction and strength of this feedback: Some accessions grew better on their own soils, some on soils from other accessions. Furthermore, we found positive diversity effects within A. thaliana: Accession mixtures produced a higher total above-ground biomass than accession monocultures. Differences between accessions in their feedback response could not be explained by morphological traits. Therefore, we suggest that they might have been caused by accession-specific accumulated soil communities, by root exudates, or by accession-specific resource use based on genetic differences that are not expressed in morphological traits. Synthesis. Our results provide some of the first evidence for intraspecific plant-soil feedback and intraspecific overyielding. These findings may have wider implications for the maintenance of variation within species and the importance of this variation for ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight the need for an increased focus on intraspecific processes in plant diversity research to fully understand the mechanisms of coexistence and ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Global predictions of increasing mean temperature and its variance result in concerns about the fate of biodiversity under future climatic conditions. On the local scale of interacting species, the response of diversity to warming will depend much on the change in interspecific interactions such as competition or predation. Using a phytoplankton model community, we conducted a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial long-term microcosm experiment (16 months) with an underlying seasonal temperature profile. We manipulated the mean temperature (Tmean), the temperature variance (Tvar), and the presence of consumers (ciliates) and monitored treatment effects on algal biomass, species composition and species richness. Temperature effects on algal biomass depended on the seasonal development and consumer presence. Algal biomass decreased with increasing Tmean at consumer absence, but increased at consumer presence. Overall, algal biomass decreased with increasing Tvar. Consumer presence reduced algal biomass from summer to winter, but then ciliates and the consumer effect disappeared. Almost all treatment combinations collapsed to monocultures after 16 months, but extinction occurred faster at higher Tmean (especially at consumer absence) and slower at consumer presence (especially at higher Tmean). Contrasting our predictions, increasing Tvar reduced richness and increased extinction rate. The treatment effects on biomass and richness were not independent, as algal species richness and biomass were positively correlated. Moreover, accelerated loss of species was consistently correlated to higher temporal variability in biomass. In conclusion, altered temperature regimes strongly affected algal biomass and diversity by interdependently altering competitive and consumer interactions.},

R. Br.], (ii) sorghum sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench × S. sudanense (Piper) Stapf], (iii) cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp], and (iv) sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.). Crops were seeded in monoculture and in three- and four-species mixtures using a replacement design where monoculture seeding rates were divided by the number of species in the intercrop. Crop biomass was sampled at ∼45 and 90 d after planting. When averaged across the nine site-years, biomass at the first and second sampling dates, respectively, of the monoculture treatments ranged from 1040 and 2500 kg ha−1 (cowpea) to 3000 and 9300 kg ha−1 (pearl millet). In general, biomass production of the legume monocultures was lower than the grass monocultures and intercrops at both sampling dates. All intercrops had land equivalent ratios (LERs) greater than one, indicating complementarity, likely a result of resource partitioning. Intercrops, particularly the four-species mixture, exhibited greater stability in yields across environments. The pearl millet-sorghum sudangrass-sunn hemp intercrop had the greatest evenness, suggesting that species selected for annual intercrops should have similar monoculture growth rates to minimize asymmetric competition.},

abstract = {1. Biotic resistance, the ability of species in a community to limit invasion, is central to our under- standing of how communities at risk of invasion assemble after disturbances, but it has yet to trans- late into guiding principles for the restoration of invasion-resistant plant communities. We combined experimental, functional, and modelling approaches to investigate processes of community assembly contributing to biotic resistance to an introduced lineage of Phragmites australis, a model invasive species in North America. We hypothesized that (i) functional group identity would be a good pre- dictor of biotic resistance to P. australis, while species identity effect would be redundant within functional group (ii) mixtures of species would be more invasion resistant than monocultures. 2. We classified 36 resident wetland plants into four functional groups based on eight functional traits. We conducted two competition experiments based on the additive competition design with P. australis and monocultures or mixtures of wetland plants. As an indicator of biotic resistance, we calculated a relative competition index (RCIavg) based on the average performance of P. australis in competition treatment compared with control. To explain diversity effect further, we partitioned it into selection effect and complementarity effect and tested several diversity–interaction models. 3. In monoculture treatments, RCIavg of wetland plants was significantly different among functional groups, but not within each functional group. We found the highest RCIavg for fast-growing annuals, suggesting priority effect. 4. RCIavg of wetland plants was significantly greater in mixture than in monoculture mainly due to complementarity–diversity effect among functional groups. In diversity–interaction models, species interaction patterns in mixtures were described best by interactions between functional groups when fitted to RCIavg or biomass, implying niche partitioning. 5. Synthesis. Functional group identity and diversity of resident plant communities are good indicators of biotic resistance to invasion by introduced Phragmites australis, suggesting niche pre- emption (priority effect) and niche partitioning (diversity effect) as underlying mechanisms. Guiding principles to understand and/or manage biological invasion could emerge from advances in commu- nity theory and the use of a functional framework. Targeting widely distributed invasive plants in different contexts and scaling up to field situations will facilitate generalization.},

abstract = {Biotic resistance is the ability of species in a community to limit the invasion of other species. However, biotic resistance is not widely used to control invasive plants. Experimental, functional, and modeling approaches were combined to investigate the processes of invasion by Ageratina altissima (white snakeroot), a model invasive species in South Korea. We hypothesized that (1) functional group identity would be a good predictor of biotic resistance to A. altissima, whereas a species identity effect would be redundant within a functional group, and (2) mixtures of species would be more resistant to invasion than monocultures. We classified 37 species of native plants into three functional groups based on seven functional traits. The classification of functional groups was based primarily on differences in life longevity and woodiness. A competition experiment was conducted based on an additive competition design with A. altissima and monocultures or mixtures of resident plants. As an indicator of biotic resistance, we calculated a relative competition index (RCIavg) based on the average performance of A. altissima in a competition treatment compared with that of the control where only seeds of A. altissima were sown. To further explain the effect of diversity, we tested several diversity–interaction models. In monoculture treatments, RCIavg of resident plants was significantly different among functional groups but not within each functional group. Fast-growing annuals (FG1) had the highest RCIavg, suggesting priority effects (niche pre-emption). RCIavg of resident plants was significantly greater in a mixture than in a monoculture. According to the diversity–interaction models, species interaction patterns in mixtures were best described by interactions between functional groups, which implied niche partitioning. Functional group identity and diversity of resident plant communities were good indicators of biotic resistance to invasion by introduced A. altissima, with the underlying mechanisms likely niche pre-emption and niche partitioning. This method has most potential in assisted restoration contexts, where there is a desire to reintroduce natives or boost their population size due to some previous level of degradation.},

abstract = {The ability to explain why multispecies assemblages produce greater biomass compared to mono-cultures, has been a central goal in the quest to understand biodiversity effects on ecosystem func-tion. Species contributions to ecosystem function can be driven by two processes: niche complementarity and a selection effect that is influenced by fitness (competitive) differences, and both can be approximated with measures of species' traits. It has been hypothesised that fitness differences are associated with few, singular traits while complementarity requires multidimen-sional trait measures. Here, using experimental data from plant assemblages, I show that the selec-tion effect was strongest when trait dissimilarity was low, while complementarity was greatest with high trait dissimilarity. Selection effects were best explained by a single trait, plant height. Complementarity was correlated with dissimilarity across multiple traits, representing above and below ground processes. By identifying the relevant traits linked to ecosystem function, we obtain the ability to predict combinations of species that will maximise ecosystem function.},

abstract = {We studied the temporal variability and resistance to perturbation of the biomassproduction of grassland communities from an experimental diversity gradient (thePortuguese BIODEPTH project site).With increasing species richness relative temporal variability (CV) of plant populations increased but that of communities decreased,supporting the insurance hypothesis and related theory. Species-rich communities weremore productive than species-poor communities in all three years although a naturalclimatic perturbation in the third year (frequent frost and low precipitation) caused anoverall decrease in biomass production. Resistance to this perturbation was constantacross the experimental species richness gradient in relative terms, supporting a similarresponse from the Swiss BIODEPTH experiment. The positive biomass response wasgenerated by different combinations of the complementarity and selection effects indifferent years. Complementarity effects were positive across mixtures on average in allthree years and positively related to diversity in one season. The complementarity effectdeclined following perturbation in line with total biomass but, counter to predictions,in relative terms overyielding was maintained in all years. Selection effects werepositively related to diversity in one year and negative overall in the other two years.The response to perturbation varied among species and for the same species growing inmonoculture and mixture, but following the frost communities were more stronglydominated by species with lower monoculture biomass and the selection effect wasmore negative. In total, our results support previous findings of a positive relationshipbetween diversity and productivity and between diversity and the temporal stability ofproduction, but of no effect of diversity on the resistance to perturbation. Wedemonstrate for the first time that the relative strength of overyielding remainedconstant during an exceptional natural environmental perturbation.},

abstract = {Accelerating rates of species extinction have prompted a growing number of researchers to manipulate the richness of various groups of organisms and examine how this aspect of diversity impacts ecological processes that control the functioning of ecosystems. We summarize the results of 44 experiments that have manipulated the richness of plants to examine how plant diversity affects the production of biomass. We show that mixtures of species produce an average of 1.7 times more biomass than species monocultures and are more productive than the average monoculture in 79% of all experiments. However, in only 12% of all experiments do diverse polycultures achieve greater biomass than their single most productive species. Previously, a positive net effect of diversity that is no greater than the most productive species has been interpreted as evidence for selection effects, which occur when diversity maximizes the chance that highly productive species will be included in and ultimately dominate the biomass of polycultures. Contrary to this, we show that although productive species do indeed contribute to diversity effects, these contributions are equaled or exceeded by species complementarity, where biomass is augmented by biological processes that involve multiple species. Importantly, both the net effect of diversity and the probability of polycultures being more productive than their most productive species increases through time, because the magnitude of complementarity increases as experiments are run longer. Our results suggest that experiments to date have, if anything, underestimated the impacts of species extinction on the productivity of ecosystems.},

Using an experimental site at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we examined whether plant diversity, plant community composition, and season influenced microbial communities. We also determined whether soil characteristics were related to differences in microbial communities. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition revealed that microbial community composition differed across a plant diversity gradient (plots contained 1, 3, 5, or over 25 species). Plant species identity also was a factor influencing microbial community composition; PLFA composition significantly varied among monocultures, and among three-species combinations that differed in plant species composition. Differences among treatments within each of these comparisons were apparent in all four sampling dates of the study. There was no consistent shift in microbial community composition between wet and dry seasons, although we did see significant changes over time. Of all measured soil characteristics, soil C/N was most often associated with changes in microbial community composition across treatment groups. Our findings provide evidence for human alteration of soil microbial communities via the alteration of plant community composition and diversity and that such changes are mediated in part by changes in soil carbon quality.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, the relationship between diversity and stability/ecosystem functioning has been widely discussed and has become a central issue in ecology. Here, we assessed the relationship between wetland plant diversity and community resilience after a disturbance. Our study area was located in the Upper Paran{\'{a}} River floodplain (Brazil). An experiment was carried out in situ (18 1m × 1m plots with richness varying from 1 to 18 species). In each plot, we recorded the number of species, total per cent vegetation cover and per cent age cover of each species. The above-ground biomass of wetland plants was removed, simulating a disturbance by animal trampling or an extreme flood. The recovery of vegetation was monitored over 3 months. According to a linear regression, the recovery of wetland plants was positively correlated with diversity. Comparisons with plots containing monocultures of one of the dominant species (Polygonum stelligerum) suggested that this species did not overyield in mixed cultures. Thus, our experiments indicate that the higher resilience in richer plots after a disturbance is mainly due to the fact that species have different resource use requirements (complementarity effect) and not due to the presence of a single, more productive species. Our experiment carried out in a more real condition (in situ) showed that biodiversity is important to wetland functioning and stability, paralleling the results obtained in laboratory and mesocosms experiments. These results also suggest that the loss of plant diversity in our study area could compromise community recovery following strong disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2012 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract = {A growing body of evidence from community genetics studies suggests that ecosystem functions supported by plant species richness can also be provided by genetic diversity within plant species. This is not yet true for the diversity-resistance relationship as it is still unclear whether damage by insect herbivores responds to genetic diversity in host plant populations. We developed a manipulative field experiment based on a synthetic community approach, with 15 mixtures of one to four oak (Quercus robur) half-sib families. We quantified genetic diversity at the plot level by genotyping all oak saplings and assessed overall damage caused by ectophagous and endophagous herbivores along a gradient of increasing genetic diversity. Damage due to ectophagous herbivores increased with the genetic diversity in oak sapling populations as a result of higher levels of damage in mixtures than in monocultures for all families (complementarity effect) rather than because of the presence of more susceptible oak genotypes in mixtures (selection effect). Assemblages of different oak genotypes would benefit polyphagous herbivores via improved host patch location, spill over among neighbouring saplings and diet mixing. By contrast, genetic diversity was a poor predictor of the abundance of endophagous herbivores, which increased with individual sapling apparency. Plant genetic diversity may not provide sufficient functional contrast to prevent tree sapling colonization by specialist herbivores while enhancing the foraging of generalist herbivores. Long term studies are nevertheless required to test whether the effect of genetic diversity on herbivory change with the ontogeny of trees and local adaptation of specialist herbivores.},

abstract = {The reduction of insect herbivory is one of the services provided by tree diversity in forest ecosystems. While it is increasingly acknowledged that the compositional characteristics of tree species assemblages play a major role in triggering associational resistance to herbivores, underlying mechanisms are less well known. We addressed this question in the ORPHEE experiment by assessing pine processionary moth infestations (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) across a tree diversity gradient from pine monocultures to five species mixtures. We showed that tree species richness per se had no effect on the probability of attack by this pest. By contrast, the infestation rate was strongly dependent on plot composition. Mixtures of pines (Pinus pinaster) and birches (Betula pendula) were less prone to T. pityocampa infestations, whereas mixtures of pines and oaks (Quercus spp.) were more often attacked than pine monocultures. By taking into account the relative height of pines and associated broadleaved species, this effect could be explained by pine apparency. Pines were on average 343. ±. 5. cm height. Birches, as fast growing trees, were slightly taller than pines (363. ±. 6. cm), while oak trees were significantly smaller (74. ±. 1. cm). Host trees of T. pityocampa were then partly hidden in mixtures of pines and birches but more apparent in mixtures with oaks. We suggest that reduced pine apparency disrupted visual cues used by female moths to select host trees prior to oviposition. This study highlights the need to take into account tree traits such as growth rate when selecting the tree species that have to be associated in order to improve forest resistance to pest insects.},

abstract = {The magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events are predicted to increase in the future due to ongoing climate change. In particular, floods and droughts resulting from climate change are thought to alter the ecosystem functions and stability. However, knowledge of the effects of these weather events on soil fauna is scarce, although they are key towards functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Plant species richness has been shown to affect the stability of ecosystem functions and food webs. Here, we used the occurrence of a natural flood in a biodiversity grassland experiment that was followed by a simulated summer drought experiment, to investigate the interactive effects of plant species richness, a natural flood, and a subsequent summer drought on nematode communities. Three and five months after the natural flooding, effects of flooding severity were still detectable in the belowground system. We found that flooding severity decreased soil nematode food-web structure (loss of K-strategists) and the abundance of plant feeding nematodes. However, high plant species richness maintained higher diversity and abundance of higher trophic levels compared to monocultures throughout the flood. The subsequent summer drought seemed to be of lower importance but reversed negative flooding effects in some cases. This probably occurred because the studied grassland system is well adapted to drought, or because drought conditions alleviated the negative impact of long-term soil waterlogging. Using soil nematodes as indicator taxa, this study suggests that high plant species richness can maintain soil food web complexity after consecutive environmental perturbations.},

abstract = {* Most experimental evidence on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning comes from ecosystems with fast-growing plants, such as grasslands. Although forests provide essential ecological services, they have been less well investigated. * We used dendrochronology to compare the tree radial growth rates of four important timber species in replicated, spatially mapped stands that differed in tree composition and diversity within a central European managed forest. * Growth rates differed among species but were largely unaffected by the density of neighbouring trees. * Increasing stand diversity enhanced individual growth rates, after accounting for the effects of tree density and size. These increases were statistically indistinguishable among the four species. In contrast, the effects of stand and neighbourhood species composition on growth rates were non-significant. * Policy implications. Our study of long-established central European forest stands revealed levels of tree diversity can be increased in managed forests, with the potential for modest increases in tree growth rates. These results suggest that in addition to the biodiversity and risk mitigation benefits associated with shifting practices away from monoculture management, increased carbon sequestration and yields in mature forests are likely to be realized. Our results suggest that it is possible to increase forest diversity with little or no costs to production and even with the potential for modest increases in tree growth rates.},

abstract = {Background: In the industrial biotechnology, ligninolytic enzymes are produced by single fungal strains. Experimental evidence suggests that co-culture of ligninolytic fungi and filamentous microfungi results in an increase laccase activity. In this topic, only the ascomycete Trichoderma spp. has been studied broadly. However, fungal ligninolytic-filamentousmicrofungi biodiversity interaction in nature is abundant and poorly studied. The enhancement of laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) activities of Trametes maxima as a function of time inoculation of Paecilomyces carneus and under several culture conditions using Plackett-Burman experimental design (PBED) were investigated. Results: The highest increases of laccase (12,382.5 U/mg protein) and MnP (564.1 U/mg protein) activities were seen in co-cultures I3 and I5, respectively, both at 10 d after inoculation. This level of activity was significantly different from the enzyme activity in non-inoculated T. maxima (4881.0 U/mg protein and 291.8 U/mg protein for laccase and MnP, respectively). PBED results showed that laccase was increased (P b 0.05) by high levels of glucose, (NH4)2SO4 and MnSO4 and low levels of KH2PO4, FeSO4 and inoculum (P b 0.05). In addition, MnP activity was increased (P b 0.05) by high yeast extract, MgSO4, CaCl2 and MnSO4 concentrations. Conclusions: Interaction between indigenous fungi: T. maxima-P. carneus improves laccase and MnP activities. The inoculation time of P. carneus on T. maxima plays an important role in the laccase and MnP enhancement. The nutritional requirements for enzyme improvement in a co-culture system are different from those required for a monoculture system. {\textcopyright} Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent empirical studies have shown that genetic factors can influence the invasion success of alien species. Like species diversity, higher genetic diversity can increase plant performance or invasion success via selection effects or complementarity effects. The latter have also been referred to as non-additive effects because in this case individual genotypes show a different performance in mixtures than in monocultures. Based on a manipulation experiment in the field, a recent study found that such non-additive effects of genotype mixing become stronger over time in an invasive plant, probably due to higher resource uptake or facilitation between genotypes. Other researchers criticized this interpretation because in their view complementarity or non-additive effects should lead to transgressive over-performance which could not occur based on selection effects alone, where simply differences of performance between genotypes would enhance the invasion ability of multiple-genotype patches. In a commentary paper we applied Monte Carlo permutation and Loreau and Hector's additive partitioning to two datasets and found that although transgressive over-performance cannot occur due to only selection effects and thus is the most stringent test for the existence of complementarity effects, complementarity effects also commonly occur without transgressive over-performance.},

abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi influence interactions among plant species through enhancing nutrient uptake and possibly facilitating nutrient transport among plants. However, the effects of one plant species on coexisting plant species with regard to mycorrhizal colonization are not well understood. We examined root mycorrhizal colonization and phosphorus (P) acquisition of plants in a highly P-limiting soil in Lanxi city, Zhejiang, China from the year 2000 to 2002. Three dominant native plant species with different mycorrhizal properties, Digitaria ciliaris (poorly mycorrhizal species), Ixeris denticulate (moderately mycorrhizal species) and Kummerowia striata (highly mycorrhizal species), were planted in experimental plots. In the monocultures, K. striata was found to have the highest infection and D. ciliaris the lowest mycorrhizal infection, but shoot P-concentration was higher in both I. denticulate and D. ciliaris than that in K. striata. In the mixtures, D. ciliaris and I. denticulate did not significantly affect the mycorrhizal colonization, spore production and shoot P-concentration of K. striata plants, but K. striata and I. denticulate significantly increased root mycorrhizal colonization and shoot P-concentration of D. ciliaris. K. striata enhanced but D. ciliaris reduced mycorrhizal infection and shoot P-concentration of I. denticulate. These results suggested that highly mycorrhizal plant species may positively impact coexisting species with respect to mycorrhizal colonization and P acquisition, but the effects on poorly mycorrhizal species are less predictable. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Due to their potential to enhance soil biodiversity and fertility, tree-based intercropping (TBI) systems are recognized as promising agrotechnologies. However, few studies have examined the effects of TBI on the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. To investigate this aspect, and to compare TBI with a more typical forest plantation (FO) system, a field experiment using soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. SO3-W4) and poplar (Populus nigra L. × P. maximowiczii cv. A. Henry 'Max 5') was conducted on an arable field site in southwestern Qu{\'{e}}bec. The species of AM fungi colonizing the roots were assessed by PCR-RFLP and DNA sequence analyses of SSU rRNA genes. A total of 13 different phylotypes were identified. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that these belonged to the genera Glomus (11), Acaulospora (1) and Scutellospora (1). The AM fungal diversity, as expressed by the Shannon-Wiener indices, were 0.82 ± 0.08 for the soybean and 0.70 ± 0.11 for poplar under the TBI system, and 0.53 ± 0.08 for poplar under the FO system. The study also investigated the distribution of AM fungal spores in the soil, and this differed in the two systems. Under the TBI system, spore abundance increased with increasing distance from the poplar trunk, while it remained relatively constant under the FO system. Our results also show that neighbouring trees and soybean plants hosted different AM fungal communities, suggesting that TBI systems may enhance AM fungal richness compared to monocultures. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The ability of various ecosystems to perform vital functions such as biodiversity production, and water, energy and nutrient cycling depends on the ecosystem state, i.e. health. Ecosystem state assessment has been a topic of intense research, but has reached a point at which accurate large scale (e.g. regional to global scale) modelling and monitoring are hindered by limitations in conventional assessment methods such as direct field sampling, modelling from environmental drivers such as temperature, precipitation and available nutrients, and modelling from remote sensing data. The Ecosystem-Earth Observation (Eco-EO) research group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), South Africa has highlighted the need in remote sensing research for an integrated sensing approach at the systems level. This perspective is based on the assumption that a modelling approach that exploits the strength of the various techniques (in situ environmental variables, direct field observation and remote sensing data) could potentially improve the assessment of ecosystem state at various geographic scales. In this light, the Eco-EO research group has embarked on an agro-system state assessment project since 2007 as a first step towards the implementation of the integrated modelling approach for various ecosystems. The agro-system consists of a monoculture forest plantation of Eucalyptus grandis situated in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This paper presents preliminary results from the KwaZulu-Natal E. grandis experimental study.},

abstract = {Research into mixed-forests has increased substantially in the last decades but the extent to which the new knowledge generated meets practitioners' concerns and is adequately transmitted to them is unknown. Here we provide the current state of knowledge and future research directions with regards to 10 questions about mixed-forest functioning and management identified and selected by a range of European forest managers during an extensive participatory process. The set of 10 questions were the highest ranked questions from an online prioritization exercise involving 168 managers from 22 different European countries. In general, the topics of major concern for forest managers coincided with the ones that are at the heart of most research projects. They covered important issues related to the management of mixed forests and the role of mixtures for the stability of forests faced with environmental changes and the provision of ecosystem services to society. Our analysis showed that the current scientific knowledge about these questions was rather variable and particularly low for those related to the management of mixed forests over time and the associated costs. We also found that whereas most research projects have sought to evaluate whether mixed forests are more stable or provide more goods and services than monocultures, there is still little information on the underlying mechanisms and trade-offs behind these effects. Similarly, we identified a lack of knowledge on the spatio-temporal scales at which the effects of mixtures on the resistance and adaptability to environmental changes are operating. Our analysis may help researchers to identify what knowledge needs to be better transferred and to better design future research initiatives meeting practitioner's concerns.},

abstract = {Austral summer frosts in the Andean highlands are ubiquitous throughout the crop cycle, causing yield losses. In spite of the existing warming trend, climate change models forecast high variability, including freezing temperatures. As the potato center of origin, the region has a rich biodiversity which includes a set of frost resistant genotypes. Four contrasting potato genotypes--representing genetic variability--were considered in the present study: two species of frost resistant native potatoes (the bitter Solanum juzepczukii, var. Luki, and the non-bitter Solanum ajanhuiri, var. Ajanhuiri) and two commercial frost susceptible genotypes (Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum var. Alpha and Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigenum var. Gendarme). The objective of the study was to conduct a comparative growth analysis of four genotypes and modeling their agronomic response under frost events. It included assessing their performance under Andean contrasting agroecological conditions. Independent subsets of data from four field experiments were used to parameterize, calibrate and validate a potato growth model. The validated model was used to ascertain the importance of biodiversity, represented by the four genotypes tested, as constituents of germplasm mixtures in single plots used by local farmers, a coping strategy in the face of climate variability. Also scenarios with a frost routine incorporated in the model were constructed. Luki and Ajanhuiri were the most frost resistant varieties whereas Alpha was the most susceptible. Luki and Ajanhuiri, as monoculture, outperformed the yield obtained with the mixtures under severe frosts. These results highlight the role played by local frost tolerant varieties, and featured the management importance--e.g. clean seed, strategic watering--to attain the yields reported in our experiments. The mixtures of local and introduced potatoes can thus not only provide the products demanded by the markets but also reduce the impact of frosts and thus the vulnerability of the system to abiotic stressors.},

abstract = {Grassland productivity can be estimated using individual-centred models or via crop simulators parameterized to mimic average morphological and physiological features of the phytocoenosis as a whole. Although the latter is often considered an oversimplified solution, individual-centred models are characterized by a degree of complexity that often restricts their use to scientists specialized in pastures modelling or in crop-weed interaction. In this study, an intermediate solution is presented (CoSMo), based on two assumptions allowing the use of a single instance of a generic crop model to simulate phytocoenosis dynamics and productivity. The first is that community parameters can be derived at each time step from the relative presence of the different species and from parameter values determined for the species in monoculture. The second is that inter-specific competition and changes in species relative presence can be simulated as a function of species-specific responses to hierarchically arranged drivers (triggered and continuous) representing the suitability of the different species to the conditions explored at each time step. CoSMo was here analyzed by means of three simulation experiments, where changes in the relative presence of three species with different traits and the productivity of the community were simulated under current conditions and future climate projections. Results encourage further studies, given that the solution proposed is easy to implement and parameterize, and leaves users free to work with the generic crop simulator they are familiar with. These features make CoSMo suitable for being coupled - within integrated studies - to models developed for other domains by scientists not specialist in the ecophysiological aspects involved with inter-specific competition. However, this approach cannot be considered as an alternative to individual-centred models in case of in silico studies explicitly focusing on the relationships between inter-specific competition and species traits and phenotypic plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1. The storage of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil is important ecosystem functions. Grassland biodiversity experiments have shown a positive effect of plant diversity on soil C and N storage. However, these experiments all included legumes, which constitute an important N input through N2-fixation. Indeed, the results of these experiments suggest that N2 fixation by legumes is a major driver of soil C and N storage. 2. We studied whether plant diversity affects soil C and N storage in the absence of legumes. In an 11-year grassland biodiversity experiment without legumes, we measured soil C and N stocks. We further determined above-ground biomass productivity, standing root biomass, soil organic matter decomposition and N mineralization rates to understand the mechanisms underlying the change in soil C and N stocks in relation to plant diversity and their feedbacks to plant productivity. 3. We found that soil C and N stocks increased by 18% and 16% in eight-species mixtures com- pared to the average of monocultures of the same species, respectively. Increased soil C and N stocks were mainly driven by increased C input and N retention, resulting from enhanced plant pro- ductivity, which surpassed enhanced C loss from decomposition. Importantly, higher soil C and N stocks were associated with enhanced soil N mineralization rates, which can explain the strengthen- ing of the positive diversity–productivity relationship observed in the last years of the experiment. 4. Synthesis. We demonstrated that also in the absence of legumes, plant species richness promotes soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks via increased plant productivity. In turn, enhanced soil C and N stocks showed a positive feedback to plant productivity via enhanced N mineralization, which could further accelerate soil C and N storage in the long term.},

abstract = {Increasing plant species richness generally enhances plant biomass production, which may enhance accumulation of carbon (C) in soil. However, the net change in soil C also depends on the effect of plant diversity on C loss through decomposition of organic matter. Plant diversity can affect organic matter decomposition via changes in litter species diversity and composition, and via alteration of abiotic and/or biotic attributes of the soil (soil legacy effect). Previous studies examined the two effects on decomposition rates separately, and do therefore not elucidate the relative importance of the two effects, and their potential interaction. Here we separated the effects of litter mixing and litter identity from the soil legacy effect by conducting a factorial laboratory experiment where two fresh single root litters and their mixture were mixed with soils previously cultivated with single plant species or mixtures of two or four species. We found no evidence for litter-mixing effects. In contrast, root litter-induced CO2 production was greater in soils from high diversity plots than in soils from monocultures, regardless of the type of root litter added. Soil microbial PLFA biomass and composition at the onset of the experiment was unaffected by plant species richness, whereas soil potential nitrogen (N) mineralization rate increased with plant species richness. Our results indicate that the soil legacy effect may be explained by changes in soil N availability. There was no effect of plant species richness on decomposition of a recalcitrant substrate (compost). This suggests that the soil legacy effect predominantly acted on the decomposition of labile organic matter. We thus demonstrated that plant species richness enhances root litter-induced soil respiration via a soil legacy effect but not via a litter-mixing effect. This implies that the positive impacts of species richness on soil C sequestration may be weakened by accelerated organic matter decomposition.},

abstract = {Recent ecological research provides evidence that an increased number of plant species in natural grasslands is associated with increased biomass productivity, and provides a wide range of other ecosystem benefits. This suggests that increases in species diversity in agricultural ecosystems may similarly lead to increased benefits. The work reported below was part of the COST 852 Agrodiversity experiment, carried out at 34 sites across Europe. In Ireland, the effects of four-species grass-clover mixtures on herbage production, species persistence and unsown species suppression at three sites over multiple years, were investigated under growing conditions that were intensive relative to unfertilised natural grassland systems. The design included a range of four-species mixtures and monocultures of perennial ryegrass, timothy, cocksfoot, white clover, red clover and Caucasian clover. Several harvests were taken at each site for two or three years. Species diversity had a strong, persistent and positive effect on overall yield and the yield of sown species, and enhanced resistance to the growth of unsown species. Mixtures generally yielded well when compared with the best monoculture, and sometimes out yielded it. These effects on total yield declined over time but were still important at the end of the experiments. The diversity effects on sown species yield and on resistance to unsown species increased with time. Diversity effects were robust to changes in species composition, and persisted for the duration of the experiments across mixtures and over time. Virtually every mixture had a higher yield, and suppressed unsown species better, than monocultures of perennial ryegrass. These patterns were broadly consistent across sites. The persistence of species varied widely and was not consistent across sites.},

abstract = {1. Genotypic diversity in plant populations is known to enhance plant performance and ecosystem function. Nonetheless, the effect of genotypic diversity has rarely been examined across a population's lifecycle despite the expectation that changing conditions, such as population density, will alter the benefits of diversity. 2. We simultaneously manipulated a component of genotypic diversity (richness, the number of genotypes) and density of common evening primrose Oenothera biennis to address the consequences for herbivory and lifetime fitness in a 2-year field experiment that spanned seed germination to lifetime fruit production. We genotyped >1100 seedlings with microsatellite DNA markers to determine realized diversity and density in plots sown with O. biennis seeds. Our design achieved quantitative variation in plant density and diversity, with one to 44 individuals established in field plots and two to eight genotypes per polyculture plot (based on microsatellite analysis of reproductive plants). 3. We found a strong interaction between seed density and genetic diversity, with germination and establishment being 24% higher in genetic polycultures than monocultures, but only at low seed density. At high seed density, the opposite pattern emerged, with polycultures having 12% fewer individuals established than monocultures. Initial effects of emergence on plot density persisted through to the fruiting stage. 4. Higher plant densities resulted in increased mortality, decreased probability of reproduction, decreased plant height and lower levels of lifetime fruit production per plant. Increasing genotypic diversity increased the probability of reproduction overall and showed a significant interaction with plant density mitigating the negative effects of high density on individual height and lifetime fruit production. 5. Synthesis. Plant density and genotypic diversity interacted from the very early stages of seed germination and establishment of Oenothera biennis. This effect persisted over the 2-year life cycle of plants, and genotypic diversity buffered against the negative fitness consequences of high plant density. These results imply a dynamic interplay between the long-held paradigm of density effects in plant ecology and the genetic structure of populations.},

abstract = {The effects of herbivores and diversity on plant communities have been studied separately but rarely in combination. We conducted two concurrent experiments over 3 years to examine how tree seedling diversity, density and herbivory affected forest regeneration. One experiment factorially manipulated plant diversity (one versus 15 species) and the presence/absence of deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We found that mixtures outperformed monocultures only in the presence of deer. Selective browsing on competitive dominants and associational protection from less palatable species appear responsible for this herbivore-driven diversity effect. The other experiment manipulated monospecific plant density and found little evidence for negative density dependence. Combined, these experiments suggest that the higher performance in mixture was owing to the acquisition of positive interspecific interactions rather than the loss of negative intraspecific interactions. Overall, we emphasize that realistic predictions about the consequences of changing biodiversity will require a deeper understanding of the interaction between plant diversity and higher trophic levels. If we had manipulated only plant diversity, we would have missed an important positive interaction across trophic levels: diverse seedling communities better resist herbivores, and herbivores help to maintain seedling diversity.},

abstract = {The replacement of native forests by exotic tree monocultures, such as those of Eucalyptus, decreases the quality of leaf litter inputs to streams and often reduces riparian cover, which can elevate water temperature. The combined effects of these stressors on the survival and performance of detritivores may be important, as detritivore species loss leads to reduced litter breakdown, a key ecosystem process. Potential loss of cased caddisfly larvae is of particular concern because they are the predominant detritivores in many streams, they are sensitive to warming, and they expend energy on building and carrying their cases, which may be an added burden under times of stress. In a microcosm experiment, we tested whether (i) poor-quality Eucalyptus globulus litter impaired case construction by larvae of Sericostoma pyrenaicum (due to preferential allocation of the scarcer available energy to larval fitness) compared to high-quality Alnus glutinosa litter; (ii) whether this effect was enhanced by higher temperatures (15 vs. 10°C) resulting in faster metabolism and greater energy expenditure; but (iii) reduced in the presence of chemical cues from a predatory fish (due to greater investment in more protective cases). We found that Eucalyptus had lethal and sublethal effects on larval caddisflies, increasing mortality, reducing growth, and impairing case construction, compared to larvae fed Alnus. Temperature did not reinforce the effects of exotic litter on case construction, but predator chemical cues triggered the construction of more protective cases (i.e., longer and better cemented) despite the lower resource quality, providing evidence for environmentally mediated resource-allocation tradeoffs.},

abstract = {Ecosystems worldwide are increasingly impacted by multiple drivers of environmental change, including climate warming and loss of biodiversity. We show, using a long-term factorial experiment, that plant diversity loss alters the effects of warming on productivity. Aboveground primary productivity was increased by both high plant diversity and warming, and, in concert, warming (≈1.5°C average above and belowground warming over the growing season) and diversity caused a greater than additive increase in aboveground productivity. The aboveground biodiversity effects increased over time, particularly at higher levels of diversity, perhaps because of warming-induced increases in legume and C4 bunch grass abundances, and facilitative feedbacks of these species on productivity. Moreover, higher plant diversity was associated with the amelioration of warming-induced environmental conditions. This led to cooler temperatures, increased vapor pressure deficit, and increased surface soil moisture in higher diversity communities. Root biomass (0-30 cm) was likewise consistently greater at higher plant diversity, and was greater with warming in monocultures and at intermediate diversity, but at high diversity warming had no detectable effect. This may be because warming increased the abundance of legumes, which have lower root:shoot ratios than the other types of plants. In addition, legumes increase soil nitrogen supply, which could make N less limiting to other species and potentially decrease their investment in roots. The negative warming x diversity interaction on root mass led to an overall negative interactive effect of these two global change factors on the sum of above and belowground biomass, and thus likely on total plant carbon stores. In total, plant diversity increased the effect of warming on aboveground net productivity and moderated the effect on root mass. These divergent effects suggest that warming and changes in plant diversity are likely to have both interactive and divergent impacts on various aspects of ecosystem functioning.

abstract = {Global change drivers are rapidly altering resource availability and biodiversity. While there is consensus that greater biodiversity increases the functioning of ecosystems, the extent to which biodiversity buffers ecosystem productivity in response to changes in resource availability remains unclear. We use data from 16 grassland experiments across North America and Europe that manipulated plant species richness and one of two essential resources-soil nutrients or water-to assess the direction and strength of the interaction between plant diversity and resource alteration on above-ground productivity and net biodiversity, complementarity, and selection effects. Despite strong increases in productivity with nutrient addition and decreases in productivity with drought, we found that resource alterations did not alter biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Our results suggest that these relationships are largely determined by increases in complementarity effects along plant species richness gradients. Although nutrient addition reduced complementarity effects at high diversity, this appears to be due to high biomass in monocultures under nutrient enrichment. Our results indicate that diversity and the complementarity of species are important regulators of grassland ecosystem productivity, regardless of changes in other drivers of ecosystem function.},

abstract = {1. Some farming practices, like organic farming, lead to greater numbers of weed plants in crop fields. These fields may give us some insights into any benefits that may be gained from biodiversity (e.g. improved pest control services) and allow us to understand the mechanisms behind crop–weed interactions. 2. The influence of two common weeds, lamb's-quarters Chenopodium album and charlock Sinapis arvensis, on performance of the bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi in spring- sown barley Hordeum vulgare is evaluated in three field experiments. Observations in field experiments indicated that the presence of S. arvensis reduced aphid population development in the barley crop significantly, but this effect was not observed in barley grown with C. album. 3. Observed effects in the field were further studied in laboratory experiments with regard to aphid growth and reproductive performance. Above- and below-ground interactions of S. arvensis and C. album with barley were tested using twin-exposure cages. Aphid perfor- mance was negatively affected when barley plants had root contact with S. arvensis. The results of these laboratory experiments showed a difference in mode of action of the two weeds. 4. Synthesis and applications. The results support the potential of associated resistance, medi- ated by neighbouring plants, in minimizing herbivore damage of focal plants and highlighted the mechanism by which herbivores might be affected. Since chemical exchange between plant neighbours can potentially occur in any plant community, increased understanding could be valuable for existing and new agroecosystems, invasion biology and sustainable crop produc- tion. To get a balance between herbicide and insecticide control, agricultural production sys- tems need to focus on the thresholds of weed and insect tolerance, taking the associated resistance of biodiversity (here weeds) into account. Agricultural biodiversity may provide many long-term benefits over monoculture, from reducing pesticide pollution to preventing insecticide resistance. Our study is an important step forward in general understanding of the effects of vegetational diversity on herbivore population dynamics.},

abstract = {Mixed forests are thought to be less prone to pest insect damage than monocultures. This may result from reduced host availability (i.e., density effect) or from non-host trees reducing the physical or chemical apparency of host trees (i.e., associational resistance, AR). However, associational and density effects are often confounded in mixed forests. We aimed to disentangle their relative contribution to attacks of pine trees by a specialist pest, the pine processionary moth (PPM, Thaumetopoea pityocampa). We assessed pine infestation by PPM by counting the number of winter nests during three consecutive years along an experimental gradient of pine density in presence or absence of a fast growing species, namely birch. The total number of PPM nests per plot increased with pine density (maximum in high density monocultures), while the proportion of attacked pine trees decreased along the same gradient. Birch provided associational resistance via reduced pine apparency due to their greatest higher. This mechanism occurred at two spatial scales, whenever birch was planted within pine plots or in adjacent plots. Associational resistance was stronger in dense stands, probably due to reduced distance between pines and neighboring birches. But AR faded with time, pines becoming taller than birches, making density effects preeminent over apparency effects. Our findings suggest that mixing tree species to trigger resistance to pest insects requires taking into account the relative growth rate of associated species together with the relative proportion of associated species, both within and between stands.},

abstract = {Concern about forestry practices creating tree-level monoculture plantations exists. Our study investigates tree diversity responses for six early seral boreal forest plantations in Ontario, Canada, representing three conifer species; black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana), 14 release treatments, and 94 experimental units. Dominance-diversity curves and Simpson's indices of diversity and evenness indicate tree alpha diversity. We propose a new method for assessing diversity, using percentage of theoretical species maximum (%TSM) which is determined by comparing post-disturbance richness (S) with a theoretical species maximum (TSM). Our results support the hypothesis that alternative vegetation release treatments generally do not reduce tree species diversity levels (%TSM) relative to untreated plots. The only %TSM (P <= 0.05) comparison that produced less diversity than in control plots was repeated annual treatments of Vision herbicide at one of the black spruce study sites. Our results generally support the hypothesis that tree monocultures do not develop after vegetation release.

abstract = {Previous research has found that plant diversity declines more quickly in exotic than native grassland plots, which offers a model system for testing whether diversity decline is associated with specific plant traits. In a common garden experiment in the Southern Great Plains in central Texas, USA, we studied monocultures and 9-species mixtures of either all exotic or all native grassland species. A total of 36 native and exotic species were paired by phylogeny and functional group. We used community-level measures (relative abundance in mixture) and whole-plant (height, aboveground biomass, and light capture) and leaf-level traits (area, specific leaf area, and C:N ratio) to determine whether trait differences explained native-exotic differences in functional group diversity. Increases in species' relative abundance in mixture were correlated with high biomass, height, and light capture in both native and exotic communities. However, increasing exotic species were all C4 grasses, whereas, increasing native species included forb, C3 grass and C4 grass species. Exotic C4 grasses had traits associated with relatively high resource capture: greater leaf area, specific leaf area, height, biomass, and light capture, but similar leaf C:N ratios compared to native C4 grasses. Leaf C:N was consistently higher for native than exotic C3 species, implying that resource use efficiency was greater in natives than exotics. Our results suggest that functional diversity will differ between grasslands restored to native assemblages and those dominated by novel collections of exotic species, and that simple plant traits can help to explain diversity decline.},

abstract = {The role of species richness, functional diversity and species identity of native Florida sandhill understory species were tested with Imperata cylindrica, an exotic rhizomatous grass, in mesocosms. I. cylindrica was introduced 1 year after the following treatments were established: a control with no native species, five monocultures, a grass mix treatment, a forb mix treatment, and a 3-species treatment and a 5-species treatment. Monthly cover, final biomass, root length, root length density (RLD) and specific root length (SRL) of all species were determined for one full growing season. There was a significant negative linear relationship between the cover of native species and I. cylindrica (r (2) = 0.59, P = 0.01) and a negative logarithmic relationship between the biomass of native species and I. cylindrica (r (2) = 0.70, P = 0.003). There was no diversity-invasibility relationship. Grasses proved to be the most resistant functional group providing resistance alone and in mixed functional communities. Repeated measures analysis demonstrated that treatments including Andropogon virginicus were the most resistant to invasion over time (P < 0.001). Significantly greater root length (P = 0.002), RLD (P = 0.011) and SRL (P < 0.001) than all of the native species and I. cylindrica in monocultures and in mixed communities made A. virginicus successful. The root morphology characteristics allowed it to be a great competitor belowground where I. cylindrica was most aggressive. The results suggest that species identity could be more important than species or functional richness in determining community resistance to invasion.},

abstract = {The intrinsic growth rate of non-selective microbivores increases asymptotically with increasing prey biomass, but we do not know how intrinsic growth rate is affected by prey richness. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of prey richness on the growth kinetics of nematode predators while grazing on mixed bacterial lawns. We found that the intrinsic growth rate of Caenorhabditis elegans in laboratory culture increased asymptotically with prey richness. The mechanism of this pattern was primarily due to the best available prey species in the mixture: the intrinsic growth rate of the consumer feeding on a mixture of prey was approximately equal to the intrinsic growth rate of the predator when feeding on the single best prey in monoculture. This was analogous to the selection effect observed in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Generation time, and not reproductive output, was the life history trait component that was most consistent with the pattern of intrinsic growth rate. Our results suggest that in order to link invertebrate consumers' growth rates to their microbial species composition in the field, it will be necessary to determine the ability of microbivorous invertebrates to selectively forage in natural environments and to better understand the micro-scale distribution of microbial communities in their natural environments.},

abstract = {Several biodiversity experiments have shown positive effects of species richness on aboveground biomass production, but highly variable responses of individual species. The well-known fact that the competitive ability of plant species depends on size differences among species, raises the question of effects of community species richness on small-stature subordinate species. We used experimental grasslands differing in species richness (1-60 species) and functional group richness (one to four functional groups) to study biodiversity effects on biomass production and ecophysiological traits of five small-stature herbs (Bellis perennis, Plantago media, Glechoma hederacea, Ranunculus repens and Veronica chamaedrys). We found that ecophysiological adaptations, known as typical shade-tolerance strategies, played an important role with increasing species richness and in relation to a decrease in transmitted light. Specific leaf area and leaf area ratio increased, while area-based leaf nitrogen decreased with increasing community species richness. Community species richness did not affect daily leaf carbohydrate turnover of V. chamaedrys and P. media indicating that these species maintained efficiency of photosynthesis even in low-light environments. This suggests an important possible mechanism of complementarity in such grasslands, whereby smaller species contribute to a better overall efficiency of light use. Nevertheless, these species rarely contributed a large proportion to community biomass production or achieved higher yields in mixtures than expected from monocultures. It seems likely that the allocation to aboveground plant organs to optimise carbon assimilation limited the investment in belowground organs to acquire nutrients and thus hindered these species from increasing their performance in multi-species mixtures.},

abstract = {Climate warming and plant species richness loss have been the subject of numerous experiments, but studies on their combined im- pact are lacking. Here we studied how both warming and species richness loss affect water use in grasslands, while identifying interactions be- tween these global changes. Experimental eco- systems containing one, three or nine grassland species from three functional groups were grown in 12 sunlit, climate-controlled chambers (2.25 m2 ground area) in Wilrijk, Belgium. Half of these chambers were exposed to ambient air temperatures (unheated), while the other half were warmed by 3?C (heated). Equal amounts of water were added to heated and unheated communities, so that warming would imply drier soils if evapotranspiration (ET) was higher. After an initial ET increase in response to warming, stomatal regulation and lower above-ground productivity resulted in ET values comparable with those recorded in the unheated communities. As a result of the decreased biomass production, water use efficiency (WUE) was reduced by warming. Higher complementarity and the im- proved competitive success of water-efficient species in mixtures led to an increased WUE in multi-species communities as compared to monocultures, regardless of the induced warming. However, since the WUE of individual species was affected in different ways by higher temper- atures, compositional changes in mixtures seem likely under climatic change due to shifts in competitiveness. In conclusion, while increased complementarity and selection of water-efficient species ensured more efficient water use in mix- tures than monocultures, global warming will likely decrease this WUE, and this may be most pronounced in species-rich communities.},

abstract = {In the debate on the influence of declining plant diversity on ecosystem functioning, spatial aggregation has received little attention, in spite of the fact that the local distribution of species determines interaction. Using a simple conceptual model, we visualize the effect that clumping has on below ground resource uptake (RU). Two general conclusions can be drawn from the model: (1) clumping results in a loss of RU, and does so to a larger extent when species differ more in rooting depth and when plant density increases; (2) the current view on complementarity may be flawed, as we find that neighborhood species richness only promotes spatial complementarity directly at the transition from monocultures to higher species richness levels, but not at transitions between higher richness levels. The number of species in a community does, however, affect the probability of the occurrence of clumping. In randomly assembled communities, clumps are statistically larger when the number of species is lower, leading to reduced overall below ground complementarity. Complementarity, and thus also RU, will therefore increase indirectly with increasing species richness. As a result of our findings, we propose that clumping could have a number of 'hidden' consequences, for example on invasibility of a community and on competition between species. Clumping could also prove to be a new and important explanatory factor in diversity studies, as it extends the definition of complementarity effects to include the effect of spatial heterogeneity of plant positions within the community.},

abstract = {Previous studies on biodiversity and soil food web composition have mentioned plant species identity, as well as plant species diversity as the main factors affecting the abundance and diversity of soil organisms. However, most studies have been carried out under limitations of time, space, or appropriate controls. In order to further examine the relation between plant species diversity and the soil food web, we conducted a threeyear semi-field experiment in which eight plant species (4 forb and 4 grass species) were grown in monocultures and mixtures of two, four and eight plant species. In addition there were communities with 16 plant species. We analyzed the abundance and identity of the nematodes in soil and roots, including feeding groups from various trophic levels (primary and secondary consumers, carnivores, and omnivores) in the soil food web. Plant species diversity and plant identity affected the diversity of nematodes. The effect of plant diversity was attributed to the complementarity in resource quality of the component plant species rather than to an increase in total resource quantity. The nematode diversity varied more between the different plant species than between different levels of plant species diversity, so that plant identity is more important than plant diversity. Nevertheless the nematode diversity in plant mixtures was higher than in any of the plant monocultures, due to the reduced dominance of the most abundant nematode taxa in the mixed plant communities. Plant species identity affected the abundances of the lower trophic consumer levels more than the higher trophic levels of nematodes. Plant species diversity and plant biomass did not affect nematode abundance. Our results, therefore, support the hypothesis that resource quality is more important than resource quantity for the diversity of soil food web components and that plant species identity is more important than plant diversity per se.},

Here, we develop a theory that predicts the temporal variability of community biomass from the properties of individual component species in monoculture. Our theory shows that biodiversity stabilises ecosystems through three main mechanisms: (1) asynchrony in species' responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) reduced demographic stochasticity due to overyielding in species mixtures and (3) reduced observation error (including spatial and sampling variability). Parameterised with empirical data from four long-term grassland biodiversity experiments, our prediction explained 22–75% of the observed variability, and captured much of the effect of species richness. Richness stabilised communities mainly by increasing community biomass and reducing the strength of demographic stochasticity. Our approach calls for a re-evaluation of the mechanisms explaining the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem stability.},

abstract = {In addition to an increase in mean temperature, climate change models predict decreasing amplitudes of daily temperature fluctuations. In temperate regions, where daily and seasonal fluctuations are prominent, such decreases in daily temperature fluctuations can have a pronounced effect on the fitness of species and on the outcome of species interactions. In this study, the effect of a temperature regime with daily fluctuations versus a constant temperature on the fitness and interspecific interactions of three cryptic species of the marine nematode species complex of Litoditis marina (Pm I, Pm III and Pm IV) were investigated. In a lab experiment, different combinations of species (monospecific treatment: Pm I and Pm IV and Pm III alone; two-species treatment: Pm I + Pm IV; three-species treatment: Pm I + Pm IV + Pm III) were subjected to two different temperature regimes: one constant and one fluctuating temperature. Our results showed that fluctuating temperature had minor or no effects on the population fitness of the three species in monocultures. In contrast, interspecific interactions clearly influenced the fitness of all three species, both positively and negatively. Temperature regime did have a substantial effect on the interactions between the species. In the two-species treatment, temperature regime altered the interaction from a sort of mutualism to commensalism. In addition, the strength of the interspecific interactions changed depending on the temperature regime in the three-species treatment. This experiment confirms that interactions between the species can change depending on the abiotic environment; these results show that it is important to incorporate the effect of fluctuations on interspecific interactions to predict the effect of climate change on biodiversity.},

In this work, it was evaluated relations between soil physical properties and nematode community under sugarcane cropping and remaining of Atlantic Forest areas in Northeastern Pernambuco, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from September to November 2009 along two 200-m transects in both remaining of Atlantic Forest and sugarcane field at deeps of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 cm. For soil characterization, it was carried out analysis of soil size, water content, total porosity, bulk density, and particle density. The level of soil mechanical resistance was evaluated through a digital penetrometer. Nematodes were extracted per 300 cm(3) of soil through centrifugal flotation in sucrose being quantified, classified according trophic habit, and identified in level of genus or family. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation at 5% of probability. Geostatistical analysis showed that the penetration resistance, water content, total porosity, and bulk density on both forest and cultivated area exhibited spatial dependence at the sampled scale, and their experimental semivariograms were fitted to spherical and exponential models. In forest area, the ectoparasites and free-living nematodes exhibited spherical model. In sugarcane field, the soil nematodes exhibited pure nugget effect. Pratylenchus sp. and Helicotylenchus sp. were prevalent in sugarcane field, but in forest, there was prevalence of Dorylaimidae and Rhabditidae. Total amount of nematode did not differ between environments; however, community trophic structure in forest presented prevalence of free-living nematodes: omnivores followed by bacterial-feeding soil nematodes, while plant-feeding nematodes were prevalent in sugarcane field. The nematode diversity was higher in the remaining of Atlantic Forest. However, the soil mechanical resistance was higher under sugarcane cropping, affecting more directly the free-living nematodes; especially Dorylaimidae which was the most sensible to changes in soil physical properties.},

abstract = {Two primary approaches to perennial biofuel crop production studied so far are fertilized grass monocultures and low-input high-diversity grasslands. While high-yielding perennial grass varieties are being developed in fertilized monocultures, breeding for yield in low-input high-diversity systems would be difficult. Before initiating breeding for low-input systems, it is therefore important to know the minimum number of functional groups and species required for maximum biomass harvest from low-input grasslands. We controlled the number of perennial grassland species in 168 plots in Minnesota, USA. Species were selected at random from a pool of 18, and 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 were planted in each plot. Aboveground biomass was measured annually, and the plots were burned each spring. We found a strongly positive log-linear relationship between average annual aboveground biomass and planted species number, but a large proportion of plot-to-plot variability remained unexplained. We performed a conditional analysis of the aboveground biomass data to determine whether considering species identity would reduce the minimum number of species necessary in order to achieve yields similar to the highest diversity treatments. A model that accounted for the presence of legumes in general, and for the presence of the legume species Lupinus perennis in particular, showed no increase in biomass yield with increased species number. Over 11 years, average yields of L. perennis/C4grass bicultures were similar to those of 16-species (maximum diversity) plots, and both were >200% greater than the average of monocultures. Thus, under low-input conditions, the choice of the appropriate few perennial plant species for each location might result in systems with biomass yields similar to those from high-diversity systems. Because breeding biofuel crops in diverse mixtures would introduce complexity that is unwarranted in terms of maximum biomass yield, the first biofuel crop breeding programs for low-input systems are likely to accelerate progress by focusing on grass-legume bicultures. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These units were established in three\nsecondary forests areas, where once thinned or cleared, valuable annual\nand perennial species were introduced.\nTotal biomass and product yields were analyzed, also labour invested on\neach production unit was recorded, units were compared on an efficiency\nbasis. Maize yield of polyculture is low but total production is more\nthan twice that of maize monoculture. Efficiency in the polyculture is\nalso higher and its weeds were better controlled. After three years the\n`milpa' has become an orchard with more than 150 individual fruit trees\nbelonging to 10 different species. Enriched secondary forests show the\nhighest biomass production in the open treatment, 68% transmittance,\nand the highest survivorship in the moderate shade treatment, 37%.\nSchizolobium parahybum and Cordia alliodora were the most successful\nforest species due to their fast growth.},

abstract = {1. In a laboratory experiment, the influence of host plant diversity and food quality, in terms of nitrogen content, on the larval survival of two oligophagous bug species (Heteroptera, Miridae: Leptopterna dolobrata L., Notostira erratica L.) was investigated. Both species are strictly phytophagous and capable of feeding on a wide range of grass species. Moreover, they typically change their host plants during ontogenesis; it has been suggested that this behaviour is a response to the changing protein content of the hosts.2. To investigate the importance of host plant diversity for these insects, the development of insects reared on grass monocultures was compared with that on mixtures of four grass species. In addition, the host grasses were grown under two nitrogen regimes to test whether nitrogen content is the key factor determining host plant switching.3. Both species had a significantly higher survival rate when feeding on several host plants but only L. dolobrata showed a significant response to food nitrogen content. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the nitrogen content of the host plants and the survival rate of N. erratica larvae.4. The study suggests that at least some Stenodemini need a variety of host plants during larval development but that the level of host plant nitrogen is not the main factor responsible for the observed diversity effect.

abstract = {Soil respiration is an important pathway of the C cycle. However, it is still poorly understood how changes in plant community diversity can affect this ecosystem process. Here we used a long-term experiment consisting of a gradient of grassland plant species richness to test for effects of diversity on soil respiration. We hypothesized that plant diversity could affect soil respiration in two ways. On the one hand, more diverse plant communities have been shown to promote plant productivity, which could increase soil respiration. On the other hand, the nutrient concentration in the biomass produced has been shown to decrease with diversity, which could counteract the production-induced increase in soil respiration. Our results clearly show that soil respiration increased with species richness. Detailed analysis revealed that this effect was not due to differences in species composition. In general, soil respiration in mixtures was higher than would be expected from the monocultures. Path analysis revealed that species richness predominantly regulates soil respiration through changes in productivity. No evidence supporting the hypothesized negative effect of lower N concentration on soil respiration was found. We conclude that shifts in productivity are the main mechanism by which changes in plant diversity may affect soil respiration},

abstract = {Biodiversity experiments show that increases in plant diversity can lead\nto greater biomass production, and some researchers suggest that high\ndiversity plantings should be used for bioenergy production. However,\nmany methods used in past biodiversity experiments are impractical for\nbioenergy plantings. For example, biodiversity experiments often use\nintensive management such as hand weeding to maintain low diversity\nplantings and exclude unplanted species, but this would not be done for\nbioenergy plantings. Also, biodiversity experiments generally use high\nseeding densities that would be too expensive for bioenergy plantings.\nHere we report the effects of biodiversity on biomass production from\ntwo studies of more realistic bioenergy crop plantings in southern\nMichigan, USA. One study involved comparing production between\nswitchgrass (Panicum virgatum) monocultures and species-rich prairie\nplantings on private farm fields that were managed similarly to\nbioenergy plantings. The other study was an experiment where switchgrass\nwas planted in monoculture and in combination with increasingly\nspecies-rich native prairie mixtures. Overall, we found that bioenergy\nplantings with higher species richness did not produce more biomass than\nswitchgrass monocultures. The lack of a positive relationship between\nplanted species richness and production in our studies may be due to\nseveral factors. Non-planted species (weeds) were not removed from our\nstudies and these non-planted species may have competed with planted\nspecies and also prevented realized species richness from equaling\nplanted species richness. Also, we found that low seeding density of\nindividual species limited the biomass production of these individual\nspecies. Production in future bioenergy plantings with high species\nrichness may be increased by using a high density of inexpensive seed\nfrom switchgrass and other highly productive species, and future efforts\nto translate the results of biodiversity experiments to bioenergy\nplantings should consider the role of seeding density.},

abstract = {Invasive, non-native plant species often outcompete native species and reduce biodiversity. Invasive plants frequently begin growth before native plants, yet few studies have examined whether invasives win in competition partly by colonizing disturbed sites more quickly or by beginning growth earlier in the season than native plants (i.e. due to priority effects). We hypothesized that invasive plant species would benefit more from priority effects than would comparable native species and that earlier growth of invasive species would decrease plant biodiversity. To test this hypothesis, we grew three pairs of invasive and native plant species from three different functional groups/plant families (C-3 grasses/Poaceae, non-leguminous forbs/Asteraceae, and legumes/Fabaceae). We seeded each of the species 3 weeks before seeding the other five species into large pots in a greenhouse. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found much stronger priority effects with invasive than native species. Each invasive species formed a near-monocultures when seeded first (97.5 % of total biomass, on average) whereas native species did not similarly dominate (29.8 % of total biomass, on average). Similarly, Simpson's species diversity was 81 % higher when the initially sown species was native rather than invasive. The literature suggests that invasive species in the field often begin growth earlier in the spring than native species and that climate change may increasingly allow invasives to begin growth before native species, indicating invasive priority effects may become increasingly common.},

abstract = {Plants can affect soil organic matter decomposition and mineralization through litter inputs, but also more directly through root-microbial interactions (rhizosphere effects). Depending on resource availability and plant species identity, these rhizosphere effects can be positive or negative. To date, studies of rhizosphere effects have been limited to plant species grown individually. It is unclear how belowground resources and inter-specific interactions among plants may influence rhizosphere effects on soil C decomposition and plant N uptake. In this study, we tested the simple and interactive effects of plant diversity and water availability on rhizosphere-mediated soil C decomposition and plant N uptake. The study was conducted in the greenhouse with five semi-arid grassland species (monocultures and mixtures of all five species) and two water levels (15 and 20% gravimetric soil moisture content). We hypothesized that microbial decomposition and N release would be less in the low compared to high water treatment and less in mixtures compared to monocultures. Rhizosphere effects on soil C decomposition were both positive and negative among the five species when grown in monoculture, although negative effects prevailed by the end of the experiment. When grown in mixture, rhizosphere effects reduced soil C decomposition and plant N uptake compared to monocultures, but only at the low-water level. Our results suggest that when water availability is low, plant species complementarity and selection effects on water and N use can decrease soil C decomposition through rhizosphere effects. Although complementarity and selection effects can increase plant N uptake efficiency, plant N uptake in the mixtures was still lower than expected, most likely because rhizosphere effects reduced N supply in the mixtures more than in the monocultures. Our results indicate that rhizosphere effects on C and N cycling depend on water availability and inter-specific plant interactions. Negative rhizosphere effects on soil C decomposition and N supply in mixtures relative to monocultures of the component species could ultimately increase soil C storage and possibly influence how plant communities in semi-arid grasslands respond to global climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) is a promising method of biomass production for energy purposes, but there have been concerns about the low diversity of these stands, including the risk for pest outbreaks. Mixing different clones has been advised as a way to tackle this problem and improve yields through positive diversity effects. Recent research into the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning supports these recommendations, but also raises worries about mechanisms that may confound results, such as a selection effect due to dominant clones outcompeting weaker ones. However, the few available studies on diversity effects in SRC plantations did not allow the disentangling of the mechanisms at play.We used data from an experimental SRC site, which incorporated three Swedish Salix clones in a row-based mixing design. Productivity was expected to be greater in mixtures and we attempted to elucidate whether this was due to a complementarity or a selection effect. We found that complementarity effects were generally larger than selection effects, yet the total diversity effect on yield was not significant. Leaf surface temperature measurements indicated that drought stress was unlikely to be the factor underlying this distorted diversity productivity relationship. We also found that a less-productive clone (Gudrun) had a different stem biomass distribution when in monoculture, which may have repercussions for the quality of the harvested product and points at a so far less recognized potential benefit of mixing.},

abstract = {This paper reports the findings of a short-term natural invasibility field study in constructed Mediterranean herbaceous communities of varying diversities, under a fire treatment. Three components of invasibility, i.e. species richness, density and biomass of invaders, have been monitored in burnt and unburnt experimental plots with resident diversity ranging from monocultures to 18-species mixtures. In general, species richness, density and biomass of invaders decreased significantly with the increase of resident species richness. Furthermore, the density and biomass of invading species were significantly influenced by the species composition of resident communities. Although aboveground biomass, leaf area index, canopy height and percent bare ground of the resident communities explained a significant part of the variation in the success of invading species, these covariates did not fully explain the effects of resident species richness. Fire mainly influenced invasibility via soil nutrient levels. The effect of fire on observed invasibility patterns seems to be less important than the effects of resident species richness. Our results demonstrate the importance of species richness and composition in controlling the initial stages of plant invasions in Mediterranean grasslands but that there was a lack of interaction with the effects of fire disturbance.},

abstract = {Plant diversity is generally thought to enhance productivity, driven by either (1) chance inclusion of highly productive species in more diverse communities or (2) niche-based resource acquisition with competitive interactions increasing resource use efficiency. Here, we ask whether weeding, as employed in most experiments to date, might contribute to the positive diversity-productivity relationship reported for many grasslands. Using all 82 species from our local pool, we constructed 357 experimental grassland plots (2 x 4 m each), arranged as a completely randomized experiment in an arable field prepared to minimize existing seed bank. The plots were sown to vary species richness (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 species) and were maintained under both ambient conditions and experimental drought. A single monoculture plot was maintained for all 82 species, and each of the other eleven species richness levels was replicated 25 times. Plots were maintained strictly without weeding, and aboveground biomass was measured at 17, 19, 27 and 29 months after the start of this experiment. No single measure of biodiversity was significantly correlated with productivity consistently across all four sampling periods. Furthermore, there were only weak overall effects of six biodiversity variables (the species richness planted, observed, and sampled; Shannon diversity, effective species richness and evenness in the sampled area) on productivity under either precipitation treatment. Regression analysis identified no equation that used a consistent subset of the biodiversity measures as predictors. In view of these transient and insubstantial effects, results from previous experiments that employed weeding treatments are suspect as tests of the hypothesis that biodiversity has positive effects on productivity.},

abstract = {Tree species diversity has been reported to increase forest ecosystem above-ground biomass and productivity, but little is known about below-ground biomass and production in diverse mixed forests compared to single-species forests. For testing whether species richness increases below-ground biomass and production and thus complementarity between forest tree species in young stands, we determined fine root biomass and production of trees and ground vegetation in two experimental plantations representing gradients in tree species richness. Additionally, we measured tree fine root length and determined species composition from fine root biomass samples with the near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy method. We did not observe higher biomass or production in mixed stands compared to monocultures. Neither did we observe any differences in tree root length or fine root turnover. One reason for this could be that these stands were still young, and canopy closure had not always taken place, i.e. a situation where above- or below-ground competition did not yet exist. Another reason could be that the rooting traits of the tree species did not differ sufficiently to support niche differentiation. Our results suggested that functional group identity (i.e. conifers vs. broadleaved species) can be more important for below-ground biomass and production than the species richness itself, as conifers seemed to be more competitive in colonising the soil volume, compared to broadleaved species.},

Predator composition and richness strongly affected several community and population responses, mostly via sampling effects. However, some predators survived better in polycultures than in monocultures, suggesting complementarity due to stronger intra- than interspecific interactions. Predator effects also differed between additive and substitutive designs, emphasizing that the relationship between diversity and abundance in an assemblage can strongly influence whether and how diversity effects are realized. Changing herbivore richness and predator richness interacted to influence both total herbivore abundance and predatory crab growth, but these interactive diversity effects were weak.

Over four growing seasons, we followed experimental populations of a clonal, ubiquitous weed, Taraxacum officinale, with different numbers of genotypes in relatively favorable fallow field and unfavorable mowed lawn environmental treatments. Population performance (measured as total leaf area, seed production or biomass) clearly and consistently increased with diversity, and this effect became stronger over the course of the experiment. Diversity effects were stronger, and with different underlying mechanisms, in the fallow field versus the mowed lawn. Large genotypes dominated in the fallow field driving overyielding (via positive selection effects), whereas in the mowed lawn, where performance was limited by regular disturbance, there was evidence for complementarity among genotypes (with one compact genotype in particular performing better in mixture than monoculture). Hence, we predict stronger genotypic diversity effects in environments where intense intraspecific competition enhances genotypic differences. Our four-year field experiment plus seedling establishment trials indicate that genotypic diversity effects have far-reaching and context-dependent consequences across generations.},

abstract = {Most explanations for the positive effect of plant species diversity on productivity have focused on the efficiency of resource use, implicitly assuming that resource supply is constant. To test this assumption, we grew seedlings of Echinacea purpurea in soil collected beneath 10-year-old, experimental plant communities containing one, two, four, eight, or 16 native grassland species. The results of this greenhouse bioassay challenge the assumption of constant resource supply; we found that bioassay seedlings grown in soil collected from experimental communities containing 16 plant species produced 70% more biomass than seedlings grown in soil collected beneath monocultures. This increase was likely attributable to greater soil N availability, which had increased in higher diversity communities over the 10-year-duration of the experiment. In a distinction akin to the selection/complementarity partition commonly made in studies of diversity and productivity, we further determined whether the additive effects of functional groups or the interactive effects of functional groups explained the increase in fertility with diversity. The increase in bioassay seedling biomass with diversity was largely explained by a concomitant increase in N-fixer, C4 grass, forb, and C3 grass biomass with diversity, suggesting that the additive effects of these four functional groups at higher diversity contributed to enhance N availability and retention. Nevertheless, diversity still explained a significant amount of the residual variation in bioassay seedling biomass after functional group biomass was included in a multiple regression, suggesting that interactions also increased fertility in diverse communities. Our results suggest a mechanism, the fertility effect, by which increased plant species diversity may increase community productivity over time by increasing the supply of nutrients via both greater inputs and greater retention.},

abstract = {An important goal of ecologists is to identify the characteristics of\nnative communities that help to either promote or resist the invasion of\nnon-native taxa. In this study, experimental mesocosms were used to\ndetermine how the richness and species identity of freshwater consumers\ninfluenced the invasion success of Daphnia lumholtzi (DL), a cladoceran\nthat has successfully invaded aquatic habitats throughout the United\nStates. Three species of native zooplankton were used to create a\ngradient of richness in replicated mesocosms that included all species\nin monoculture, all two species combinations, and all three species\ntogether. DL was then added to each mesocosm and its biomass was\nmonitored over time. While additional research is needed to better\ndetermine how richness affects the invasion success of DL, the presence\nof native zooplankton resulted in reduced levels of DL biomass in all\ntreatments relative to the zooplankton free controls. One species\n(Daphnia magna, DM) was able to reduce the biomass of DL to lower levels\nthan the other two species. DL also appeared to be unable to establish\nor persist over time in mesocosms with DM, unlike in mesocosms with the\ntwo other species. These species-specific effects on invasion success\nappeared to be related to DM's ability to reduce algal biomass to lower\nlevels than the other two species. Therefore, while the presence of\nnative zooplankton helps to reduce the biomass of DL once it is\nintroduced into novel systems, the degree to which DL is able to\nestablish and maintain populations over time within individual systems\nwill likely depend on the presence or absence of particular species that\ncan have particularly strong impacts on invasibility. Using such data,\nwe may be able to predict which habitats are most likely to be invaded\nbased on the presence or absence of individual native species.},

abstract = {1. Over the past decade, ecologists have tried to determine how changes in species composition and diversity affect ecosystem structure and function. Until recently, the majority of these studies have been conducted in terrestrial ecosystems and have not taken into account environmental variability. The purpose of this research was to determine how species identity and diversity in the freshwater zooplankton affected biomass of algae and zooplankton at two levels of nutrient enrichment. 2. Several species of cladocerans were grown alone and together in microcosms at both ambient and raised phosphorus concentrations to determine if the effects of consumer identity and diversity were nutrient dependent. 3. Total zooplankton biomass was greater, while algal biomass was lower, in mixed culture than in monoculture. The effects of zooplankton diversity on algal biomass, however, were only observed at raised phosphorus concentrations, suggesting that diversity effects were nutrient dependent. Specifically, diversity effects appeared to be related with biological mechanisms such as complementarity in resource use and/or facilitation. 4. More diverse communities of zooplankton appear to be better able to control algae than single species of zooplankton at high nutrient concentrations; therefore, zooplankton diversity may provide a buffer against eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems.},

abstract = {Understanding how trees respond to global change drivers is central to predict changes in forest structure and functions. Although there is evidence on the mode of nitrogen (N) and drought (D) effects on tree growth, our understanding of the interplay of these factors is still limited. Simultaneously, as mixtures are expected to be less sensitive to global change as compared to monocultures, we aimed to investigate the combined effects of N addition and D on the productivity of three tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, Pseudotsuga menziesii) in relation to functional diverse species mixtures using data from a four-year field experiment in Northwest Germany. Here we show that species mixing can mitigate the negative effects of combined N fertilization and D events, but the community response is mainly driven by the combination of certain traits rather than the tree species richness of a community. For beech, we found that negative effects of D on growth rates were amplified by N fertilization (i.e. combined treatment effects were non-additive), while for oak and fir, the simultaneous effects of N and D were additive. Beech and oak were identified as most sensitive to combined N+D effects with a strong size-dependency observed for beech, suggesting that the negative impact of N+D becomes stronger with time as beech grows larger. As a consequence, the net biodiversity effect declined at the community level, which can be mainly assigned to a distinct loss of complementarity in beech-oak mixtures. This pattern, however, was not evident in the other species-mixtures, indicating that neighborhood composition (i.e. trait combination), but not tree species richness mediated the relationship between tree diversity and treatment effects on tree growth. Our findings point to the importance of the qualitative role (‘trait portfolio') that biodiversity play in determining resistance of diverse tree communities to environmental changes. As such, they provide further understanding for adaptive management strategies in the context of global change.},

abstract = {Soil microorganisms are the functional backbone of terrestrial ecosystems. Empirical evidence has accumulated highlighting the role of soil biodiversity for the functioning of ecosystems and the provision of vital ecosystem services. How can biodiversity in soil be maintained? Recent plant diversity experiments, intercropping approaches, and monitoring studies suggest that plant diversity is a crucial determinant of soil biodiversity, underlining the saying ‘biodiversity begets biodiversity'. While local plant diversity is likely to mainly increase the spatial heterogeneity of organic inputs into the soil, a review paper in this issue utilizes a meta-analysis to investigate temporal plant diversity effects on soil microbial diversity: Venter and colleagues (2016) compared crop monocultures with crop rotations and studied microbial diversity. Across studies, they found significantly higher microbial diversity in crop rotation than in crop monocultures providing some of the first synthetic empirical evidence of the beneficial effects of temporal heterogeneity in plant inputs into the soil for soil microorganisms. Future studies should investigate how ‘spatial and temporal plant diversity' effects on soil biodiversity translate into ecosystem services on which humankind relies.},

abstract = {The effect of plant diversity on aboveground organisms and processes was largely studied but there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the link between plant diversity and soil characteristics. Here, we analyzed the effect of plant identity and diversity on the diversity of extractible soil organic compounds (ESOC) using 87 experimental grassland plots with different levels of plant diversity and based on a pool of over 50 plant species. Two pools of low molecular weight organic compounds, LMW1 and LMW2, were characterized by GC-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. These pools include specific organic acids, fatty acids and phenolics, with more organic acids in LMW1 and more phenolics in LMW2. Plant effect on the diversity of LMW1 and LMW2 compounds was strong and weak, respectively. LMW1 richness observed for bare soil was lower than that observed for all planted soils; and the richness of these soil compounds increased twofold when dominant plant species richness increased from 1 to 6. Comparing the richness of LMW1 compounds observed for a range of plant mixtures and for plant monocultures of species present in these mixtures, we showed that plant species richness increases the richness of these ESOC mainly through complementarity effects among plant species associated with contrasted spectra of soil compounds. This could explain previously reported effects of plant diversity on the diversity of soil heterotrophic microorganisms.},

abstract = {Complementarity and sampling effects may both contribute to increased invasion resistance at higher diversity. We measured plant invader biomass across a long-term experimental plant diversity gradient. Invader species biomass was inhibited in more diverse plots, largely because of the presence of strongly competitive C4 bunchgrasses, consistent with a sampling effect. Invader biomass was negatively correlated with resident root biomass, and positively correlated with soil nitrate concentrations, suggesting that competition for nitrogen limited invader success. Resident root biomass increased and soil nitrate concentrations decreased with the presence of C4 grasses and also across the diversity gradient, suggesting that diverse plots are more competitive because of the presence of C4 grasses. In addition to this evidence for a sampling effect, we also found evidence for a complementarity effect. Specifically, the percentage of plots that had lower invader biomass than did the best resident monoculture (i.e. that had invader underyielding) increased across the species richness gradient. This pattern cannot be explained by a sampling effect and is a unique signature of complementarity effects. Our results demonstrate the importance of multiple mechanisms by which diversity can increase invasion resistance.},

abstract = {Species interactions can play a major role in shaping evolution in new environments. In theory, species interactions can either stimulate evolution by promoting coevolution or inhibit evolution by constraining ecological opportunity. The relative strength of these effects should vary as species richness increases, and yet there has been little evidence for evolution of component species in communities. We evolved bacterial microcosms containing between 1 and 12 species in three different environments. Growth rates and yields of isolates that evolved in communities were lower than those that evolved in monocultures, consistent with recent theory that competition constrains species to specialize on narrower sets of resources. This effect saturated or reversed at higher levels of richness, consistent with theory that directional effects of species interactions should weaken in more diverse communities. Species varied considerably, however, in their responses to both environment and richness levels. Mechanistic models and experiments are now needed to understand and predict joint evolutionary dynamics of species in diverse communities.},

abstract = {1. A coordinated continental-scale field experiment across 31 sites was used to compare the biomass yield of monocultures and four species mixtures associated with intensively managed agricultural grassland systems. To increase complementarity in resource use, each of the four spe- cies in the experimental design represented a distinct functional type derived from two levels of each of two functional traits, nitrogen acquisition (N2-fixing legume or nonfixing grass) crossed with temporal development (fast-establishing or temporally persistent). Relative abundances of the four functional types in mixtures were systematically varied at sowing to vary the evenness of the same four species in mixture communities at each site and sown at two levels of seed density. 2. Across multiple years, the total yield (including weed biomass) of the mixtures exceeded that of the average monoculture in >97% of comparisons. It also exceeded that of the best monoculture (transgressive overyielding) in about 60% of sites, with a mean yield ratio of mixture to best-performing monoculture of 107 across all sites. Analyses based on yield of sown species only (excluding weed biomass) demonstrated considerably greater transgressive overyielding (significant at about 70% of sites, ratio of mixture to best-performing monocul- ture = 118). 3. Mixtures maintained a resistance to weed invasion over at least 3 years. In mixtures, median values indicate <4% of weed biomass in total yield, whereas the median percentage of weeds in monocultures increased from 15% in year 1 to 32% in year 3. 4. Within each year, there was a highly significant relationship (P <00001) between sward evenness and the diversity effect (excess of mixture performance over that predicted from the monoculture performances of component species). At lower evenness values, increases in com- munity evenness resulted in an increased diversity effect, but the diversity effect was not sig- nificantly different from the maximum diversity effect across a wide range of higher evenness values. The latter indicates the robustness of the diversity effect to changes in species' relative abundances. 5. Across sites with three complete years of data (24 of the 31 sites), the effect of interac- tions between the fast-establishing and temporal persistent trait levels of temporal develop- ment was highly significant and comparable in magnitude to effects of interactions between N2-fixing and nonfixing trait levels of nitrogen acquisition. 6. Synthesis and applications. The design of grassland mixtures is relevant to farm-level strat- egies to achieve sustainable intensification. Experimental evidence indicated significant yield benefits of four species agronomic mixtures which yielded more than the highest-yielding monoculture at most sites. The results are relevant for agricultural practice and show how grassland mixtures can be designed to improve resource complementarity, increase yields and reduce weed invasion. The yield benefits were robust to considerable changes in the relative proportions of the four species, which is extremely useful for practical management of grass- land swards.},

abstract = {Increasing plant diversity in agroecosystems with cover crops has been a successful strategy to augment ecosystem services from agriculture, and increasing diversity of cover crops may provide even greater benefits. Productivity and ecosystem services from multi-species cover crop mixtures were measured in a 2-yr field study of 18 cover crop treatments preceding conventionally tilled corn in central Pennsylvania. Increasing the number of species in a stand increased cover crop biomass (R2 = 0.15). However, mixing cover crop species that were complementary in phenology or N acquisition strategy did not result in mixtures that produced more biomass than high yielding monocultures. Increasing cover crop biomass was positively correlated with several ecosystem services, namely weed suppression, prevention of nitrate leaching, and aboveground biomass N, but negatively impacted inorganic N availability and corn yield in the subsequent cropping season. The cover crop C/N ratio was another determinant of ecosystem services positively related to nitrate leaching prevention, but negatively related to inorganic N availability and corn yield. This study supports the long-held assumption that increasing biomass can enhance certain ecosystem services from cover crops; however, because the mixtures tested did not produce more biomass than high yielding monocultures, opportunities to increase biomass-driven services with mixtures may be limited. The correlation between biomass C/N ratio and ecosystem services in this study also indicates that functional traits, as opposed to biomass alone, will be important for predicting ecosystem services from cover crop mixtures.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society.Numerous studies have demonstrated biodiversity-productivity relationships in plant communities, and analogous genetic diversity-productivity studies using genotype mixtures of single species may show similar patterns. Alternatively, competing individuals among genotypes within a species are less likely to exhibit resource-use complementarity, even when they exhibit large differences in their effects on ecosystem function. In this study, we test the impact of genotype diversity and genetic identity on ecosystem function using an ecosystem-scale common garden experiment. Distinct tree genotypes were collected across the entire natural range of the riparian tree Populus fremontii in the USA, and grown in 1-16 genotype combination forest stands. Due to the warm climate and irrigation of the planting location along the Colorado River (AZ, USA), mature forest physiognomy with trees up to 19 m tall was achieved in just five years. Several key patterns emerged: (i) genotype richness did not predict forest productivity, suggesting a lack of net biodiversity effects; (ii) we found differences among genotype monoculture stands comparable to differences in average productivity across all forest biomes on Earth; (iii) productivity was predicted based on genetic marker similarity in trees; (iv) genetic-based differences in leaf phenology (early leaf-on and late leaf-fall timing) were correlated with >80% of the variation in tree and forest productivity irrespective of home-site conditions. Large differences in productivity among genotypes can result in dramatic differences in forest productivity without resulting in diversity-productivity relationships that are present in species-scale biodiversity studies.},

abstract = {An experiment was carried out in a climate chamber to analyse if Bt-maize may cause particular changes in soils with different levels of microbial biomass and activity due to long-term management history. Among the soils selected, the ones managed organically for 30 years exhibited twice the microbial biomass and 2.6 times the dehydrogenase activity (DHA) of the soil from a field with long-term conventional maize monoculture. Soils were cultivated twice in a row with Bt-maize, its near-isogenic line and a conventional breeding line. We tested the hypotheses that (a) soil microbial biomass and activity are affected by the cultivation of Bt-maize and that (b) the influence of Bt-maize depends on the level of soil microbial biomass and activity. Shoot and root yield and shoot C-content of Bt-maize were higher than the ones of the near-isogenic line. DHA under Bt-maize was 6 % higher, and the metabolic quotient for CO2 (qCO2) was 9 % lower than under its near-isogenic line, giving some support to hypothesis (a). No significant interactions of the soils and the varieties used were found in this study, thus hypothesis (b) was not confirmed, and soils with different microbial biomass and activity appear to react in a similar way to the cultivation of Bt-maize.},

abstract = {Two decades of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research have not yet led to consensus view on how local dominance and biodiversity affect the stability of ecosystems in the presence of disturbances. As natural systems are usually affected by multiple stressors, we tested the diversity−stability hypothesis on phytoplankton communities subjected to combinations of 2 stressors (pH reduction and simulated grazing). Monocultures revealed uncorrelated species' sensitivities to the 2 stressors and the presence of a best-performing species (Scenedesmus obliquus). We thus selected 2 experimental species combinations, either (A) including or (B) excluding S. obliquus, and inoculated at 3 diversity levels (2, 4, 8 species). Both stressors induced significant biovolume loss and increased temporal biovolume variation, but the effect on final biomass (Btot) differed between combinations and with richness. The fast recovery of S. obliquus precluded long-term disturbance effects on Btot in Combination A. Correspondingly, these communities showed slower recovery rates and lower Btot with more species present, since the strong performance of S. obliquus was diluted by more species being present. More species-rich assemblages in Combination B lost more biovolume after stressor application, whereas the recovery rates showed a more complex pattern, depending on stressor sequence and species richness. Our study suggests that the stability of communities in the face of multiple disturbances cannot be predicted from a general diversity−stability relationship alone, but depends on the correlation between species sensitivities to different stressors and on the population dynamics of a well-performing species when dominant.},

abstract = {Species loss and invasion of exotic species are two components of global biodiversity change that are expected to influence ecosystem functioning. Yet how they interact in natural settings remains unclear. Experiments have revealed two major mechanisms for the observed increase in primary productivity with plant species richness. Plant productivity may rise with species richness due to the increased amount of resources used by more diverse communities (niche complementarity) or through the increased probability of including a highly productive, dominant species in the community (sampling effect). Current evidence suggests that niche complementarity is the most relevant mechanism, whereas the sampling effect would only play a minor and transient role in natural systems. In turn, exotic species can invade by using untapped resources or because they possess a fitness advantage over resident species allowing them to dominate the community. We argue that the sampling effect can be a significant biodiversity mechanism in ecosystems invaded by dominant exotic species, and that the effect can be persistent even after decades of succession. We illustrate this idea by analyzing tree species richness–productivity relationships in a subtropical montane forest (NW Argentina) heavily invaded by Ligustrum lucidum, an evergreen tree from Asia. We found that the forest biomass increased along a natural gradient of tree species richness whether invaded by L. lucidum or not. Consistent with the sampling effect, L. lucidum invasion tripled total tree biomass irrespective of species richness, and monocultures of L. lucidum were more productive than any of the most species-rich, uninvaded communities. Hence, the sampling effect may not be restricted to randomly assembled, synthetic communities. We emphasize that studying invaded ecosystems may provide novel insights on the mechanisms underlying the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function.},

abstract = {Resource partitioning, facilitation, and sampling effect are the three mechanisms behind the biodiversity effect, which is depicted usually as the effect of plant-species richness on aboveground net primary production. These mechanisms operate simultaneously but their relative importance and interactions are difficult to unravel experimentally. Thus, niche differentiation and facilitation have been lumped together and separated from the sampling effect. Here, we propose three hypotheses about interactions among the three mechanisms and test them using a simulation model. The model simulated water movement through soil and vegetation, and net primary production mimicking the Patagonian steppe. Using the model, we created grass and shrub monocultures and mixtures, controlled root overlap and grass water-use efficiency (WUE) to simulate gradients of biodiversity, resource partitioning and facilitation. The presence of shrubs facilitated grass growth by increasing its WUE and in turn increased the sampling effect, whereas root overlap (resource partitioning) had, on average, no effect on sampling effect. Interestingly, resource partitioning and facilitation interacted so the effect of facilitation on sampling effect decreased as resource partitioning increased. Sampling effect was enhanced by the difference between the two functional groups in their efficiency in using resources. Morphological and physiological differences make one group outperform the other; once these differences were established further differences did not enhance the sampling effect. In addition, grass WUE and root overlap positively influence the biodiversity effect but showed no interactions.},

abstract = {1. The mechanisms controlling soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) accumulation are crucial for explaining why soils are major terrestrial C sinks. Such mechanisms have been mainly addressed by imposing short-term, step-changes in CO 2 , temperature and N fertilization rates on either monocultures or low-diversity plant assemblages. No studies have addressed the long-term effects of plant functional diversity (i.e. plant functional composition) on rates of soil C accumulation in N-limited grasslands where fixation is the main source of N for plants. 2. Here we measure net soil C and N accumulation to 1 m soil-depth during a 12-year-long grassland biodiversity experiment established on agriculturally degraded soils at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, USA. 3. We show that high-diversity mixtures of perennial grassland plant species stored 500% and 600% more soil C and N than, on average, did monoculture plots of the same species. More- over, the presence of C4 grasses and legumes increased soil C accumulation by 193% and 522%, respectively. Higher soil C and N accrual resulted both from increased C and N inputs via (i) higher root biomass, and (ii) from greater root biomass accumulation to 60 cm soil depth resulting from the presence of highly complementary functional groups (i.e. C4 grasses and legumes). 4. Our results suggest that the joint presence of C4 grass and legume species is a key cause of greater soil C and N accumulation in both higher and lower diversity plant assemblages. This is because legumes have unique access to N, and C4 grasses take up and use N efficiently, increasing below-ground biomass and thus soil C and N inputs. 5. Synthesis. We demonstrate that plant functional complementarity is a key reason why higher plant diversity leads to greater soil C and N accumulation on agriculturally degraded soils. We suggest the combination of key C4 grass–legume species may greatly increase ecosystem services such as soil C accumulation and biomass (biofuel) production in both high- and low-diversity N-limited grassland systems.},

abstract = {Through complementarity interactions, mixed-species forests can be more productive than monocultures, and this effect can increase with tree-species richness. However, this is not always the case. This review examines the processes and stand structural attributes that can influence diversity-productivity relationships (DPRs); how they influence resource availability, resource uptake, and resource-use efficiency; and also describes some important differences between tree-diversity versus grassland-diversity experiments. The size of the complementarity effects caused by these processes and stand structures varies along spatial and temporal gradients in resource availability and climate. These spatial and temporal dynamics have now been examined in many studies, and the general patterns are summarized using a simple framework; complementarity is predicted to increase as the availability of resource “X” declines (or climatic condition X becomes harsher) if the species interactions improve the availability, uptake, or use efficiency of resource X (or interactions improve climatic condition X). Importantly, this framework differs from the stress-gradient hypothesis to account for a wider range of inter-specific plant interactions (not only facilitation) by considering contrasting methods used to quantify species interactions while accounting for stand structure. In addition, complementarity (as opposed to facilitation) for a given species combination can increase as growing conditions improve in forests, contrary to predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis with regards to facilitation. This review indicates that while the effects of tree-species diversity on growth and other forest functions are now receiving a lot of attention, far less is known about the effects of structural diversity on growth or forest functioning. Direct measurements of the processes, as opposed to focusing mainly on growth responses, could greatly contribute to our understanding of structural diversity effects.},

A field experiment was sown on 2008 May 27 at Melfort, Saskatchewan, Canada, on a thick Black Chernozem (Udic Boroll) silty clay soil, to compare the effects on dry matter yield (DMY), protein content and species composition of perennial forage crop monocultures and mixtures, under a twocut and a three-cut management system, in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Eleven treatments consisted of monocultures of hybrid bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm.×Bromus inermis Leyss.), smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn], intermediate wheatgrass [Agropyron intermedium (Host.) Beauv.] and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.); simple mixtures of each of these individual grass species with alfalfa; a more complex mixture of all these grass species and alfalfa, and a very complex mixture consisting of the complex mixture plus meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), tall fescue [Festuca arundinacea (Schreb.) Wimm.], timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and slender wheatgrass [Elymus trachycaulus (Link) Gould ex Shinners]. The alfalfa was inoculated with rhizobium, and no fertilizer was added to any treatment during the course of the study. The two-cut system yielded higher than the three-cut system in all years. In 2009, the first cutting year, all treatments, especially under the two-cut system, produced similar forage DMY, with monoculture grasses yielding as much as that of their mixture with alfalfa. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, however, monoculture alfalfa and grass-alfalfa treatments had higher DMY than the monoculture grasses. Monoculture alfalfa also showed superior DMY than most grass-alfalfa mixtures, especially during the last 2 yr of the study. In conclusion, the inclusion of alfalfa in forage mixtures, grown in unfertilized soil, significantly increased forage yield, especially after the first production year, and these grass-alfalfa mixtures yielded almost as much as monoculture alfalfa. Also, the inclusion of alfalfa significantly increased the forage protein content over the grass alone treatments. Hybrid bromegrass, grown alone or in mixture with alfalfa, yielded similar to the other grasses tested, while crested wheatgrass did not compete as well as other main grasses, grown alone or in mixture with alfalfa. In this study, the use of complex or very complex mixtures of introduced grasses with alfalfa did not increase DMY over the simple grass-alfalfa mixtures.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Factorial manipulations of biodiversity on different trophic levels can reveal the mechanisms that govern how biomass is partitioned within and among trophic levels. Here I report results of a laboratory microcosm experiment crossing eight algal compositions (seven monocultures and a polyculture of all seven species) with five ciliate herbivore compositions (no herbivores, three monocultures, and a polyculture of all three species). Microcosms allowed comparison of short-, medium-, and long-term (dozens of generations) results. Niche differentiation allowed competing algae to coexist in the absence of herbi-vores. Surprisingly, algal polycultures produced more biomass than the most productive monocultures only in the medium term. A temporally variable relationship between the productivity of diverse and depauparate algal assemblages might reflect changes in com-petitive mechanisms over time, and/or transient dynamics, and contrasts with the predictions of simple competition models. Herbivores had little effect on total algal biomass or algal composition, in part because of the lack of a strong trade-off between algal competitive ability and edibility. Increasing algal diversity significantly reduced the biomass of one herbivore, apparently because com-petition from inedible algae reduced the productivity of edible algae. A negative effect of inedible algae on herbivore biomass accords with simple food web theory and indicates that increasing diversity on one trophic level can have negative consequences for other trophic levels. Herbivores varied little in their abilities to graze different algae. Total algal biomass, algal composition, and total herbivore biomass were independent of herbivore diversity and composition, and algal composition had only minor effects the outcome of competition among herbivores. However, the outcome of herbivore competition was predictably asym-metrical, indicating that herbivores varied in other ways, such as ability to consume alter-native food sources (bacteria). Further factorial manipulations of diversity and trophic structure are needed to improve understanding of the likely consequences of species loss in food webs. These experiments should last as long as possible, since the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem properties may depend as much on when the relation-ship is measured as on species identity and the degree of niche differentiation among species.},

abstract = {1. Niche differentiation is widely thought to promote both coexistence of many species within a trophic level, and higher total biomass of those species. However, the joint effects of changes in diversity within multiple trophic levels are unknown. The potential for niche differences to promote high diversity and biomass within a trophic level may depend on the diversity and composition of adjacent trophic levels. 2. Using a simple mechanistic model, I examine the joint consequences of changes in diversity on two adjacent trophic levels (‘predators' and ‘prey') for the total biomass of prey. Niche differences among prey reflect a trade-off between ability to compete for resources and ability to avoid/sustain predation. Niche differences among predators reflect differences in ability to consume different prey species. 3. Total prey biomass is a complex, joint function of prey and predator diversity. In particular, transgressive overyielding (when a diverse polyculture of prey outperforms any prey monoculture) can occur for some parameter values when a specialist predator mediates prey coexistence, and for a different set of parameter values when a specialist and a generalist predator together mediate prey coexistence, but is impossible when a generalist predator alone mediates prey coexistence. 4. Increased initial predator diversity tends to reduce total prey biomass even when predators cannot coexist, due to a ‘selection' effect for the most effective predator. Predators coexist only in prey polycultures. Coexisting predators can, but do not necessarily, reduce total prey biomass to a lower level than could any predator alone. 5. The niche differences that permit coexistence strongly constrain the rank order of total prey biomass across all prey and predator combinations. Knowledge of the key trade-offs that promote coexistence within food webs can allow powerful qualitative predictions of the effects of species loss on ecosystem-level properties such as total biomass.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current agricultural practices are based on growing monocultures or binary mixtures over large areas, with a resultant impoverishing effect on biodiversity at several trophic levels. The effects of increasing the biodiversity of a sward mixture on dry matter yield and unsown species invasion were studied. METHODS: A field experiment involving four grassland species [two grasses--perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata)--and two legumes--red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (Trifolium repens)], grown in monocultures and mixtures in accordance with a simplex design, was carried out. The legumes were included either as single varieties or as one of two broad genetic-base composites. The experiment was harvested three times a year over three years; dry matter yield and yield of unsown species were determined at each harvest. Yields of individual species and interactions between all species present were estimated through a statistical modelling approach. KEY RESULTS: Species diversity produced a strong positive yield effect that resulted in transgressive over-yielding in the second and third years. Using broad genetic-base composites of the legumes had a small impact on yield and species interactions. Invasion by unsown species was strongly reduced by species diversity, but species identity was also important. Cocksfoot and white clover (with the exception of one broad genetic-base composite) reduced invasion, while red clover was the most invaded species. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that it is possible to increase, and stabilize, the yield of a grassland crop and reduce invasion by unsown species by increasing its species diversity.},

abstract = {Species richness of plant communities has been demonstrated to provide resistance to invasion by unsown species, though the relationship with resource availability varies between studies. The present work involved five grassland species grown in monocultures and in four-species mixtures sown in accordance with a simplex design. The species used represented different functional groups (i.e. grasses, legumes and non-N(2)-fixing species), each of which differed internally in terms of competitiveness. I hypothesized that sown diversity would negatively affect invader performance by decreasing the availability of light and soil nitrogen (N) for invading species, and that functional composition of the sown diversity would affect the functional composition of the invading flora. The experimental plots were harvested for two years, and were fertilized with 100 kg N ha(-1) each year. The number of unsown species (classified into four functional groups) invading each plot and their proportion of the biomass harvested were recorded. The penetration of incoming light through the canopy, the apparent N uptake by the sown species from the soil, and the mineral N content in the soil were measured. I found that diverse communities captured more resources both above- and belowground, and the number of invading species and their biomass production were smaller in mixed than in monoculture plots. However, the sampling effect of one grass was also strong. These results suggest that increased resource use in diverse communities can reduce invasion.},

abstract = {In many no-till (NT) systems, residue input is low and fallow periods excessive, for which reasons soil degradation occurs. Cover crops could improve organic matter, biological activity, and soil structure. In order to study changes in soil carbon, nitrogen and microbial biomass a field experiment (2010-2012) was set up with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench.) monoculture and with cover crops. Treatments were control (NT with bare fallow), rye (Secale cereale L.) (R), rye with nitrogen fertilization (R + N), vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) (V), and rye-vetch mixture (VR) cover crops. A completely randomized block design with 4 replicates was used. Soil was sampled once a year at 0.06 and 0.12 m depth for total C, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and-nitrogen (MBN) determinations. Shoot and root biomass of sorghum and cover crops, litter biomass, and their respective carbon and nitrogen contents were determined. Soil temperatures at 0.06 and 0.12 m depth, volumetric water contents and nitrate concentrations were determined at sowing, and harvest of each crop, and during sorghum's vegetative phase. NT led to a small increase in MBC and MBN, despite low litter and root biomass residue. Cover crops increased litter, root biomass, total C, MBC, and MBN. Relationships between MBC, MBN, and root-C and -N adjusted to logistic models (R2= 0.61 and 0.43 for C and N respectively). Litter cover improved soil moisture to 45-50% water filled pore space and soil temperatures not exceeding 25 °C during the warmest month. Microbial biomass stabilized at 20.1 g C m-2and 1.9 g N m-2in the upper 0.06 m. Soil litter disappearance was a good indicator of mineral N availability. These findings support the view that cover crops, specifically legumes in NT systems can increase soil ecosystem services related to water and carbon storage, habitat for biodiversity, and nutrient availability.},

abstract = {Experimental evidence that plant species diversity has positive effects on biomass production appears to conflict with correlations of species diversity and standing biomass in natural communities. This may be due to the confounding effects of a third variable, resource availability, which has strong control over both diversity and productivity in natural systems and may conceal any positive effects of diversity on productivity. To test this hypothesis, I independently manipulated resource availability (soil fertility) and sown species diversity in a field experiment and measured their individual and interactive effects on productivity. Although fertility was a far stronger predictor of productivity than diversity, the effect of diversity on productivity significantly increased with fertility. Relative yield analyses indicated that plant mixtures of high fertility treatments significantly "overyielded," or were more productive than expected based on monoculture yields of component species. In contrast, plant mixtures of low fertility treatments had significantly lower-than-expected yields. The effect of diversity on productivity was also driven by sampling effects, where more species-rich mixtures were more likely to include particularly productive species. Unexpectedly, the strength of sampling effects was largely insensitive to fertility, although the particular species most responsible for sampling effects did change with fertility. These results suggest that positive effects of species diversity on ecosystem productivity in natural systems are likely to be masked by variation in environmental factors among habitats.},

abstract = {A longstanding concept in community ecology is that closely related species compete more strongly than distant relatives. Ecologists have invoked this ''limiting similarity hypothesis'' to explain patterns in the structure and function of biological communities and to inform conservation, restoration, and invasive-species management. However, few studies have empirically tested the validity of the limiting similarity hypothesis. Here we report the results of a laboratory microcosm experiment in which we used a model system of 23 common, co-occurring North American freshwater green algae to quantify the strength of 216 pairwise species' interactions (the difference in population density when grown alone vs. in the presence of another species) along a manipulated gradient of evolutionary relatedness (phylogenetic distance, as the sum of branch lengths separating species on a molecular phylogeny). Interspecific interactions varied widely in these bicultures of phytoplankton, ranging from strong competition (ratio of relative yield in polyculture vs. monoculture (1) to moderate facilitation (relative yield .1). Yet, we found no evidence that the strength of species' interactions was influenced by their evolutionary relatedness. There was no relationship between phylogenetic distance and the average, minimum (inferior competitor), nor maximum (superior competitor) interaction strength across all biculture communities (respectively, P ¼ 0.19, P ¼ 0.17, P ¼ 0.14; N ¼ 428). When we examined each individual species, only 17% of individual species' interactions strengths varied as a function of phylogenetic distance, and none of these relationships remained significant after Bonferoni correction for multiple tests (N ¼ 23). Last, when we grouped interactions into five qualitatively different types, the frequency of these types was not related to phylogenetic distance among species pairs (F 4, 422 ¼ 1.63, P ¼ 0.15). Our empirical study adds to several others that suggest the biological underpinnings of competition may not be evolutionarily conserved, and thus, ecologists may need to re-evaluate the previously assumed generality of the limiting similarity hypothesis.},

abstract = {The study of the interrelationship between productivity and biodiversity is a major research field in ecology. Theory predicts that if essential resources are heterogeneously distributed across a metacommunity, single species may dominate productivity in individual metacommunity patches, but a mixture of species will maximize productivity across the whole metacommunity. It also predicts that a balanced supply of resources within local patches should favor species coexistence, whereas resource imbalance would favor the dominance of one species. We performed an experiment with five freshwater algal species to study the effects of total supply of resources, their ratios, and species richness on biovolume production and evenness at the scale of both local patches and metacommunities. Generally, algal biovolume increased, whereas algal resource use efficiency (RUE) and evenness decreased with increasing total supply of resources in mixed communities containing all five species. In contrast to predictions for biovolume production, the species mixtures did not outperform all monocultures at the scale of metacommunities. In other words, we observed no general transgressive overyielding. However, RUE was always higher in mixtures than predicted from monocultures, and analyses indicate that resource partitioning or facilitation in mixtures resulted in higher-than-expected productivity at high resource supply. Contrasting our predictions for the local scale, balanced supply of resources did not generally favor higher local evenness, however lowest evenness was confined to patches with the most imbalanced supply. Thus, our study provides mixed support for recent theoretical advancements to understand biodiversity-productivity relationships.},

abstract = {Marine ecosystems are experiencing rapid and pervasive loss of species. Understanding the consequences of species loss is critical to effectively managing 25 these systems. Over the last several years, numerous experimental manipulations of species richness have been performed, yet existing quantitative syntheses have focused on a just a subset of processes measured in experiments and, as such, have not summarized the full data available from marine systems. Here, we present the results of a meta-analysis of 174 marine experiments from 42 studies that have 30 manipulated the species richness of organisms across a range of taxa and trophic levels and analysed the consequences for various ecosystem processes (categorised as production, consumption or biogeochemical fluxes). 30 manipulated the species richness of organisms across a range of taxa and trophic levels and analysed the consequences for various ecosystem processes (categorised as production, consumption or biogeochemical fluxes). Our results show that, generally, mixtures of species tend to enhance levels of ecosystem function relative to the average component species in monoculture, but 35 have no or negative effect on functioning relative to the ‘highest-performing' species. These results are largely consistent with those from other syntheses, and extend conclusions to ecological functions that are most commonly measured in the marine realm (e.g. nutrient release from sediment bioturbation). For experiments that manipulated three or more levels of richness, we attempted to discern the functional 40 form of the BEF relationship. We found that, for response variables categorised as consumption, a power-function best described the relationship, which is also consistent with previous findings. However, we identified a linear relationship between richness and production. Combined, our results suggest that losses of species will, on average, tend to alter the functioning of marine ecosystems. We outline 45 several research frontiers that will allow us to more fully understand how, why, and when diversity may drive the functioning of marine ecosystems. Key},

abstract = {The study of the relationship between species richness of a plant community and its productivity has received much attention, recently renewed by the concern on the loss of biological diversity at a global scale. Here, we briefly review some indices widely used in agronomic and competition experiments to compare monocultures and mixtures, and compare them to other, more recently designed ones. These various indices are then calculated for two experiments. In the first experiment, two grass and two legume species were grown at six levels of nitrogen availability, either in monocultures or in mixtures of the four species in a substitutive design; in the second experiment, five grass species were grown at 16 levels of total nutrient availability, either in monocultures or in mixtures of the five species in an additive design. These data clearly show that the conclusions drawn from the experiments depend on the index used to compare the experimental communities. We argue that a clear test of whether the productivity of communities increases with species richness requires that: (1) all species present in the multispecies assemblages also be grown in monocultures under the same environmental conditions, and (2) the productivity of these assemblages be compared to the most productive monoculture. We conclude that there are as yet very few cases where superior productivity of multispecies assemblages as compared to monocultures has been clearly shown.},

abstract = {In view of the projected climatic changes and the global decrease in plant species diversity, it is critical to understand the effects of elevated air temperature (Tair) and species richness (S) on physiological processes in plant communities. Therefore, an experiment of artificially assembled grassland ecosystems, with different S (one, three or nine species), growing in sunlit climate-controlled chambers at ambient Tair and ambient Tair + 3°C was established. We investigated whether grassland species would be more affected by midday high-temperature stress during summer in a warmer climate scenario. The effect of elevated T air was expected to differ with S. This was tested in the second and third experimental years by means of chlorophyll a fluorescence. Because acclimation to elevated Tair would affect the plant's stress response, the hypothesis of photosynthetic acclimation to elevated T air was tested in the third year by gas exchange measurements in the monocultures. Plants in the elevated Tair chambers suffered more from midday stress on warm summer days than those in ambient chambers. In absence of severe drought, the quantum yield of PSII was not affected by elevated T air. Our results further indicate that species had not photosynthetically acclimated to a temperature increase of 3°C after 3 years exposure to a warmer climate. Although effects of S and Tair × S interactions were mostly not significant in our study, we expect that combined effects of Tair and S would be important in conditions of severe drought events. {\textcopyright} Physiologia Plantarum 2007.},

In some cases, naturally regenerating forests are not comparable to the community structure 20 of primary forests after many decades. However, direct comparison of the outcomes of tropical forest restoration and natural regenera- tion is hindered by differences in metrics of forest recovery, inconsistency in land use histories, and dissimilarities in experimental design. 21 We present the results of a replicated reforestation experiment comparing natural regeneration and polyculture tree planting at multiple 22 diversity levels (3, 6, 9, or 12 native tree species), with uniform land use history and initial edaphic conditions.

abstract = {Few manipulative experiments that explicitly test the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function have focussed on regenerative processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. Of the studies that have taken place, most have concentrated on the effects of leaf litter diversity rather than the effects of consumer diversity on decomposition. In the present study, we established an in-situ mesocosm experiment on an intertidal mudflat in the Ythan Estuary, Scotland, to investigate the interactive effects of consumer diversity, resource diversity and microbial activity on algal consumption and decomposition. We assembled communities of three commonly occurring macrofaunal species (Hediste diversicolor, Hydrobia ulvae and Littorina littorea) in monoculture and all possible combinations of two and three species mixtures and supplied them with single vs two-species mixtures of the algae Fucus spiralis and Ulva intestinalis. Further, we also investigated whether algal decomposition changes nutrient remineralisation within the sediment by determining the C:N ratio of the surficial sediment. Data were analysed using extended linear regression with generalized least squares estimation to characterise the variance structure. We found that consumer species diversity effects are best explained by compositional effects and that species richness per se may not be the single most important determinant of resource use and decomposition in this community. Algal identity and invertebrate identity effects underpin the observed response and reflect species-specific traits associated with algal consumption and processing. The role of the microbial community is comparatively weak, but strongly linked to faunal activities and behaviour. The C:N ratio of the sediment increased with consumer species richness, indicating increased mineralisation in more diverse communities. Overall, our results suggest that although consumer species richness effects per se are weak, decomposition and subsequent incorporation of resources is nevertheless dependent on the composition of the decomposer community, which, in turn, has important implications for biogeochemical nutrient cycling in marine coastal habitats.},

We experimentally tested whether algal polycultures could be engineered to improve N- and P- nutrient-use efficiency compared to monocultures by balancing trade-offs in nutrient-use efficiency and biocrude production. We analyzed the flows of N and P through the processes of cultivation, biocrude production through hydrothermal liquefaction, and nutrient recycling in a laboratory-scale system. None of the six species we examined exhibited high N-efficiency, P-efficiency and biocrude production simultaneously; each had poor performance in at least one function (i.e. < 25th percentile). Polycultures of 2 to 6 species did not outperform the best species in any single function, but some polycultures exhibited more balanced performance and maintained all three functions at higher levels simultaneously than any of the monocultures (i.e. > 67th percentile). Moreover, certain polycultures came closer to optimizing all three functions than any of the monocultures. By balancing trade-offs between N- and P-efficiency and biocrude production, polycultures could be used to simultaneously reduce the demand for both N and P fertilizers by up to 85%.},

abstract = {Soil erosion is a key threat to many ecosystems, especially in subtropical China where high erosion rates occur. While the mechanisms that induce soil erosion on agricultural land are well understood, soil erosion processes in forests have rarely been studied. Throughfall kinetic energy (TKE) is influenced in manifold ways and often determined by the tree's leaf and architectural traits. We investigated the role of species identity in mono-specific stands on TKE by asking to what extent TKE is species-specific and which leaf and architectural traits account for variation in TKE. We measured TKE of 11 different tree species planted in monocultures in a biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning experiment in subtropical China, using sand-filled splash cups during five natural rainfall events in summer 2013. In addition, 14 leaf and tree architectural traits were measured and linked to TKE. Our results showed that TKE was highly species-specific. Highest TKE was found below Choerospondias axillaris and Sapindus saponaria, while Schima superba showed lowest TKE. These species-specific effects were mediated by leaf habit, leaf area (LA), leaf pinnation, leaf margin, stem diameter at ground level (GD), crown base height (CBH), tree height, number of branches and leaf area index (LAI) as biotic factors and throughfall as abiotic factor. Among these, leaf habit, tree height and LA showed the highest effect sizes on TKE and can be considered as major drivers of TKE. TKE was positively influenced by LA, GD, CBH, tree height, LAI, and throughfall amount while it was negatively influenced by the number of branches. TKE was lower in evergreen, simple leaved and dentate leaved than in deciduous, pinnated or entire leaved species. Our results clearly showed that soil erosion in forest plantations can be mitigated by the appropriate choice of tree species.[on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {Analysis of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity through morphological characters of spores and intraradicular hyphae has suggested previously that preferential associations occur between plants and AM fungi. A field experiment was established to investigate whether AM fungal diversity is affected by different host plants in upland grasslands. Indigenous vegetation from plots in an unimproved pasture was replaced with monocultures of either Agrostis capillaris or Lolium perenne. Modification of the diversity of AM fungi in these plots was evaluated by analysis of partial sequences in the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA (rDNA) genes. General primers for AM fungi were designed for the PCR amplification of partial sequences using DNA extracted from root tissues of A. capillaris and L. perenne. PCR products were used to construct LSU rDNA libraries. Sequencing of randomly selected clones indicated that plant roots were colonised by AM fungi belonging to the genera Glomus, Acaulospora and Scutellospora. There was a difference in the diversity of AM fungi colonising roots of A. capillaris and L. perenne that was confirmed by PCR using primers specific for each sequence group. These molecular data suggest the existence of a selection pressure of plants on AM fungal communities.},

Temperature regime and identity of fungal species inoculated in monoculture microcosms significantly affected decomposition rates: these increased with temperature, but across all temperature regimes species diversity promoted higher decomposition rate, although functional saturation seemed to occur above three species. In assemblages with at least eight species, litter decomposition was not inhibited by temperature fluctuating regime when compared with constant temperature conditions.

abstract = {The role of biodiversity in mediating ecosystem processes has been the subject of focused theoretical and empirical attention since the mid-1990s. Theory predicts that the balance between species richness and identity effects will critically depend on the degree of environmental heterogeneity, which dictates the extent to which differences between species in patterns of resource use can be expressed. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to explicitly test this hypothesis. We manipulated the richness and identity of intertidal molluscan grazers, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of the substrate upon which they grazed. The magnitude of algal consumption was used as our focal ecosystem process. The grazer treatments consisted of three monocultures and a single polyculture including all three species; heterogeneity was represented as the proportion of topographically complex and flat substrate. Species identity had strong effects on homogeneous substrates, with the identity of the best-performing species dependent on the substrate. On the heterogeneous substrate, suitable conditions for all three species were represented, allowing the expression of spatial complementarity of resource use and the enhancement of total algal consumption. Our findings provide the first explicit experimental evidence that spatial heterogeneity of the physical environment can play a key role in mediating effects of species diversity.},

abstract = {A key challenge in research linking biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is to incorporate the trophic interactions that characterise natural systems. There is a particular shortage of studies investigating consumer species richness and composition (identity) effects in the context of ecosystem development (or succession). We manipulated the richness and composition of an assemblage of molluscan grazers (Patella ulyssiponensis, Gibbula umbilicalis and Littorina littorea) added to rock pools denuded of existing biota. We created monocultures and all possible multispecies combinations in a substitutive design, and ran a field experiment for 13 mo. We used 2 separate nested analyses to isolate the roles of species richness, species composition nested within levels of species richness and the specific effect of the limpet P. ulyssiponensis, a putative key species. We found no evidence that the biomass or productivity of the developing macroalgal assemblage was affected by grazer richness or species composition nested within richness levels. Rather, the presence of P. ulyssiponensis, irrespective of the presence of other grazer species, acted to suppress mean values of these response variables. Biomass and productivity were not strongly related, showing that they provide unique information on ecosystem functioning in this system. Macroalgal species richness was also reduced by P. ulyssiponensis, and correlated positively with macroalgal biomass, indicating a link between these response variables. Macroalgal species composition was largely insensitive to either species richness or the presence of P. ulyssiponensis, but responded to particular combinations of species within levels of these factors. The key role of P. ulyssiponensis in determining ecosystem functioning is apparent from our results, but we note that consumer species richness may play an important role under more heterogeneous conditions.},

abstract = {Mixed forests are thought to provide a wide range of ecosystem services for human well-being and their effectiveness, compared to monocultures, is broadly recognized in the literature. Mixed forests may increase the multifunctionality, providing a wide range of ecosystem services such as hazard protection, carbon sequestration, nature conservation and landscape values. Before undertaking a process of conversion of monocultures into mixed forests it is important to learn about perceptions of local stakeholders for mixed forests in comparison to monocultures, in order to understand their needs and identify possible sources of conflicts. In the present work, we investigate the personal perceptions about the effectiveness of mixed forests when compared to monocultures, in terms of provisioning of ecosystem services, with the aid of an ordered logit model. In addition, we highlight the fact that belonging to a particular category of organized stakeholders contribute to perceive mixed forests positively, compared to non-organized local dwellers. Results show that people acknowledging the importance of some non-productive forest ecosystem services are more likely to prefer mixed forests. Moreover, personal attitudes towards ecosystem services seem to be much more related to the degree of preference for mixed forests than other socio-economic variables, such as gender and education. Finally, another evidence of this contribution is that belonging to a precisely defined group of stakeholders considerably increases the probability to prefer mixed forests, compared to ordinary citizens.},

abstract = {The relationship between biological diversity and ecological stability has fascinated ecologists for decades. Determining the generality of this relationship, and discovering the mechanisms that underlie it, are vitally important for ecosystem management. Here, we investigate how species richness affects the temporal stability of biomass production by reanalyzing 27 recent biodiversity experiments conducted with primary producers. We find that, in grasslands, increasing species richness stabilizes whole-community biomass but destabilizes the dynamics of constituent populations. Community biomass is stabilized because species richness impacts mean biomass more strongly than its variance. In algal communities, species richness has a minimal effect on community stability because richness affects the mean and variance of biomass nearly equally. Using a new measure of synchrony among species, we find that for both grasslands and algae, temporal correlations in species biomass are lower when species are grown together in polyculture than when grown alone in monoculture. These results suggest that interspecific interactions tend to stabilize community biomass in diverse communities. Contrary to prevailing theory, we found no evidence that species' responses to environmental variation in monoculture predicted the strength of diversity's stabilizing effect. Together, these results deepen our understanding of when and why increasing species richness stabilizes community biomass.},

abstract = {Focusing on the response of soil mesofauna to winter rye cultivation in monoculture for 90 years, the study investigated the abundance and diversity of soil-dwelling springtails, in relation to a five-field crop rotation. A long-term monoculture experiment was established in Poland in 1923 and has been continued uninterruptedly to the present time. Soil samples were taken over a period of three years (2011–2013) to determine springtail (Collembola) abundance, species composition and life-forms spectra. We hypothesize that the crop rotation indirectly, due to the residues from the previous crops and modified soil conditions, caused the increase of the abundance and species diversity of springtails in comparison to monoculture. Generally, springtails were more abundant in the soil of rye field cultivated within a 5-field crop rotation. For the majority of sampling dates the abundance of springtails was higher in that habitat in comparison to the monoculture. Also, the calculated ecological indices showed greater diversity in the crop rotation. This treatment was dominated by the three species – Hypogastrura manubrialis, Mesaphorura macrochaeta and Ceratophysella denticulata, but in the monoculture only M. macrochaeta was distinctly numerous. Hemiedaphic springtails dominated in the crop rotation, whereas in the monoculture the most abundant were euedaphic representatives. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the studied organisms were influenced by two factors – treatment and the sampling date. We suspect that the unbeneficial soil conditions in certain sampling dates had greater impact on Collembola community than the crop rotation system.},

abstract = {Stressful environments may enhance the occurrence of facilitative interspecific interactions between plants. In several regions, Zostera marina occurs in mixed assemblages. However, the potential effects of plant diversity on stress responses and stability properties of Z. marina are poorly understood. We investigated the resistance and recovery of Z. marina subjected to shading (1 mo) in a field experiment lasting 2.5 mo. We shaded Z. marina planted in mono- and polycultures (Potamogeton perfoliatus, P. pectinatus, P. filiformis) in a factorial design (Shading×Richness) at 2 m depth. We estimated the resistance and recovery of Z. marina by measuring four response variables. Polyculture Z. marina lost proportionally less biomass than monocultures, thus having a greater resistance to shading. In contrast, after a 1 mo recovery period, monocultures exhibited higher biomass gain, and a faster recovery than polycultures. Our results suggest that plant species richness enhances the resistance of Z. marina through facilitative mechanisms, while the faster recovery in monocultures is possibly due to interspecific competition. Our results highlight the need of a much better understanding of the effects of interspecific interactions on ecosystem processes in mixed seagrass meadows, and the preservation of diverse plant assemblages to maintain ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Tree diversity is an important driver of forest ecosystem functioning, hypothesised to enhance tree growth and resistance to herbivores. To test this, we assessed the relative importance of tree species richness and functional diversity on tree height growth and insect herbivore damage across three tree diversity experiments in Finland, France and Germany, established within the last fifteen years. These experiments encompass species richness gradients from monocultures up to five species mixtures, with compositions drawn from a pool of eleven tree species. Tree height growth and total insect herbivory were evaluated at both the tree species and forest plot scales. Trees in mixtures tended to grow taller, but on average received more insect herbivory relative to monocultures. Gradients of tree species richness or functional diversity had only weak impact on the magnitude of these effects. Community weighted means of specific leaf area alone captured diversity effects on tree height growth, with stronger positive effects of diversity in mixtures with high community SLA. Tree species-specific responses were highly variable. No species significantly benefited both in terms of increased growth and reduced herbivory when grown in mixtures. More species showed positive height growth responses in mixed assemblages, but only the two exotic conifers experienced associational resistance to herbivores. This large-scale study shows that tree height growth in young forest plantations tends to be higher in species mixtures than in monocultures, but incremental increases in functional diversity have, at best, weak marginal growth benefits. Moreover, there appear to be contrasting effects at forest plot versus individual species scales. Thus, while some species show lower herbivore damage in mixtures, this is not a consistent trend and contrasts the higher overall damage in mixtures observed at the forest plot scale. To improve both tree growth and resistance to herbivores in tree species mixtures seems therefore challenging.},

abstract = {Insect outbreaks in forest and agriculture monocultures led Charles Elton to propose, a half-century ago, that higher plant diversity stabilized animal foodweb dynamics in natural ecosystems. We tested this hypothesis by studying arthropod community dynamics in a long-term experimental manipulation of grassland plant species diversity. Over the course of a decade, we found that higher plant diversity increased the stability (i.e. lowered year-to-year variability) of a diverse (>700 species) arthropod community across trophic levels. As the number of plant species increased, the stability of both herbivore and predator species richness and of total herbivore abundance increased. The underlying mechanisms driving these diversity-stability relationships were plant diversity, via effects on primary productivity and plant community stability, and portfolio effects. Taken together, our results show that higher plant diversity provides more temporally consistent food and habitat resources to arthropod foodwebs. Consequently, actively managing for high plant diversity may have stronger than expected benefits for increasing animal diversity and controlling pest outbreaks.},

abstract = {For seven years, village-based recorders monitored fish catches and water levels in seven floodplain-associated lakes of the Lower Rufiji, Tanzania. The lakes differ in the number of days and volume of inflows from the river, and thus provide a natural experiment to explore the links between catch composition, income per hour of fishing (IPHF) and hydrological connectivity, and to analyse the response of the users. The fishers adapt their fishing mode and equipment to achieve a rather constant IPHF of between 0.2 and 0.8 US$/fisher/hour. In situations of low connectivity, during a series of drought years, the less well-connected lakes lost many species and became a virtual monoculture of Oreochromis urolepis. Only in one extreme case was average fish size significantly reduced, indicating a high fishing pressure. Catch was therefore highly resilient to shifts toward illegal, non-selective and active fishing techniques. Fish diversity and lake productivity were quickly re-established when the larger lakes reconnected. The potential impacts of changes in the flood hydrograph (through dams, increased abstraction or climate/land-use changes) are assessed, and management options discussed.{\textcopyright} 2011 Copyright 2011 IAHS Press.},

abstract = {Intensive farming focusing on monoculture grass species to maximise forage production has led to a reduction in the extent and diversity of species-rich grasslands. However, plant communities with higher species number (richness) are a potential strategy for more sustainable production and mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Research has indicated the need to understand opportunities that forage mixtures can offer sustainable ruminant production systems. The objective of the two experiments reported here were to evaluate multiple species forage mixtures in comparison to ryegrass-dominant pasture, when conserved or grazed, on digestion, energy utilisation, N excretion, and methane emissions by growing 10-15 month old heifers. Experiment 1 was a 4×4 Latin square design with five week periods. Four forage treatments of: (1) ryegrass (control); permanent pasture with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne); (2) clover; a ryegrass:red clover (Trifolium pratense) mixture; (3) trefoil; a ryegrass:birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) mixture; and (4) flowers; a ryegrass:wild flower mixture of predominately sorrel (Rumex acetosa), ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), were fed as haylages to four dairy heifers. Measurements included digestibility, N excretion, and energy utilisation (including methane emissions measured in respiration chambers). Experiment 2 used 12 different dairy heifers grazing three of the same forage treatments used to make haylage in experiment 1 (ryegrass, clover and flowers) and methane emissions were estimated using the sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer technique. Distribution of ryegrass to other species (dry matter (DM) basis) was approximately 70:30 (clover), 80:20 (trefoil), and 40:60 (flowers) for experiment 1. During the first and second grazing rotations (respectively) in experiment 2, perennial ryegrass accounted for 95 and 98% of DM in ryegrass, and 84 and 52% of DM in clover, with red clover accounting for almost all of the remainder. In the flowers mixture, perennial ryegrass was 52% of the DM in the first grazing rotation and only 30% in the second, with a variety of other flower species occupying the remainder. Across both experiments, compared to the forage mixtures (clover, trefoil and flowers), ryegrass had a higher crude protein (CP) content (P<0.001, 187 vs. 115gkg -1 DM) and DM intake (P<0.05, 9.0 vs. 8.1kgday -1). Heifers in experiment 1 fed ryegrass, compared to the forage mixtures, had greater total tract digestibility (gkg -1) of DM (DMD; P<0.008, 713 vs. 641) and CP (CPD, P<0.001, 699 vs. 475), and used more intake energy (%) for body tissue deposition (P<0.05, 2.6 vs. -4.9). For both experiments, heifers fed flowers differed the most compared to the ryegrass control for a number of measurements. Compared to ryegrass, flowers had 40% lower CP content (P<0.001, 113 vs. 187gkg -1), 18% lower DMD (P<0.01, 585 vs. 713gkg -1), 42% lower CPD (P<0.001, 407 vs. 699gkg -1), and 10% lower methane yield (P<0.05, 22.6 vs. 25.1gkg -1 DM intake). This study has shown inclusion of flowers in forage mixtures resulted in a lower CP concentration, digestibility and intake. These differences were due in part to sward management and maturity at harvest. Further research is needed to determine how best to exploit the potential environmental benefits of forage mixtures in sustainable ruminant production systems.},

abstract = {Creating a crop-heterogeneous system by intraspecific mixtures of different rice varieties can substantially reduce blast diseases. Such variety mixtures provide an ecological approach for effective disease control, maintaining high yields with the minimum fungicide applications. Whether such an approach is universally applicable for random rice variety combinations and what is the variation pattern of the diseases under intercropping still remains unclear. We conducted two-year large-scale field experiments involving 47 rice varieties/lines and 98 variety-combinations to compare the occurrence of rice blast in monoculture and intercropping plots at multiple sites. In the experiments, the plant height of the selected traditional varieties was about 30 cm taller, and their life cycle was 10 days longer, than that of the improved rice varieties. The monoculture included either traditional or modern rice varieties grown in separate plots. The intercropping included both traditional and modern rice varieties planted together in the same plots. Results from the field experiments under natural disease conditions demonstrated significant reduction for rice blast disease in intercropping plots, compared with that in monoculture plots. For traditional varieties, the average blast incidence reduced from $\sim$26% in monoculture to $\sim$10% in intercropping, and the disease severity reduced from $\sim$17 in monoculture to $\sim$5 in intercropping. For modern varieties, the average blast incidence reduced from $\sim$19% in monoculture to $\sim$10% in intercropping, and the severity from $\sim$10 in monoculture to $\sim$4 in intercropping. Traditional rice varieties ($\sim$72%) had a much greater increase in the efficiency of disease control than modern varieties ($\sim$60%). In addition, substantially lower values of variance in the blast incidence and severity was detected among the variety combinations in intercropping plots than in monoculture plots. Based on these results, we conclude that the intercropping or mixture of rice varieties greatly reduces the occurrence and variation of rice blast disease in particular variety combinations, which makes the intercropping system more stable and consistent for disease suppression on a large scale of rice cultivation.},

abstract = {Restoring ecosystem services in agriculture is vital to reach a sustainable food production. More specifically, developing farming practices which enhance biological pest control is a main issue for today's agriculture. The aim of this study was to assess whether the two strategies of complicating the search of host plants by pests by increasing plant diversity, and of supporting their natural enemies by managing habitats, could be combined simultaneously at the field scale to restore biological pest control and reduce chemical insecticide use. In Gembloux (Belgium), wildflower strips (WFS) were sown within wheat crops in which pests (i.e., aphids), their predators (i.e. aphidophagous hoverflies, lacewings and ladybeetles) and parasitoid wasps were monitored for 10 weeks in the period of May through July 2015 as indicators of the ES of pest control. Aphids were significantly reduced and adult hoverflies favoured in wheat in between WFS, compared to monoculture wheat plots. No significant differences were observed for adult lacewings, ladybeetles and parasitoids. In all treatments, very few lacewing and ladybeetle larvae were observed on wheat tillers. The abundance of hoverfly larvae was positively correlated with the aphid density on tillers in between WFS, showing that increasing food provisions by multiplying habitats within fields, and not only along margins, can help supporting aphidophagous hoverflies in crops. By enhancing the ecosystem services of biological pest control, this study shows that increasing both plant diversity and managing habitats for natural enemies may reduce aphid populations, hence insecticide use. Future research should continue this vein of work by quantifying the link between agricultural practices and the delivery of ecosystem services in order to guide future measures of agricultural policies.},

abstract = {Contemporary biodiversity experiments, in which plant species richness is manipulated and aboveground productivity of the system measured, generally demonstrate that lowering plant species richness reduces productivity. However, we propose that community density may in part compensate for this reduction of productivity at low diversity. We conducted a factorial experiment in which plant functional group richness was held constant at three, while plant species richness increased from three to six to 12 species and community density from 440 to 1050 to 2525 seedlings m-2. Response variables included density, evenness and above- and belowground biomass at harvest. The density gradient converged slightly during the course of the experiment due to about 10% mortality at the highest sowing density. Evenness measured in terms of aboveground biomass at harvest significantly declined with density, but the effect was weak. Overall, aboveground, belowground and total biomass increased significantly with species richness and community density. However, a significant interaction between species richness and community density occurred for both total and aboveground biomass, indicating that the diversity- productivity relationship was flatter at higher than at lower density. Thus, high species richness enabled low-density communities to reach productivity levels otherwise seen only at high density. The relative contributions of the three functional groups C3, C4 and nitrogen-fixers to aboveground biomass were less influenced by community density at high than at low species richness. We interpret the interaction effects between community density and species richness on community biomass by expanding findings about constant yield and size variation from monocultures to plant mixtures. {\textcopyright} 2005 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.

abstract = {1. Over 5000 trees were grown in plots of differing diversity levels (1, 3 and 6 species) in a plantation established in Panama. Four and five years after establishment, we analysed parameters related to the productivity of this tropical plantation (tree survival, height and biomass as well as plot basal area) to test for the presence of biodiversity effects. The relative importance of environmental heterogeneity (such as soil, topography, and drainage) and biodiversity on tree growth and mortality was determined using partial redundancy analysis. 2. Hierarchical clustering revealed nine different soil clusters based on soil quality and drainage. By chance, the six-species plots were apparently established on more variable soils then on the other diversity levels. We found little evidence for spatial autocorrelation between subplots, with the exception of four subplots located on a ridge that extends on the North-South axis of the plantation and corresponds to a zone of higher productivity. 3. The redundancy analysis indicated that environmental heterogeneity and biodiversity together explained around 50% of the variation in subplot productivity and tree mortality. Environment explained 35-57% of the variation in productivity and mortality, respectively, whereas diversity explained an additional 23-30%. 4. Our simulation model revealed a significant positive effect of biodiversity on growth but no effect of biodiversity on mortality. The standardized effect sizes that we used to detect over- or under-yielding or no effect in comparison with monoculture were highly variable and the variability was largely explained by traits related to site topography. 5. Synthesis. In our tropical tree plantation, we detected biodiversity effects at a scale relevant to conservation and quantified the relative importance of environmental heterogeneity and diversity on tree growth and mortality. Our results support the idea that environmental factors could act as hidden sources of variability in biodiversity experiments. Environmental and spatial heterogeneity induced variable responses to biodiversity and amplified the differences between three- and six-species plots. Species identity explained more variation in productivity than did the species diversity. One species, Cedrela odorata, was associated with increased productivity.},

abstract = {We derive and test some assumptions and predictions of the Sampling Effect Hypothesis (SEH) by examining the relationship between the traits of species in monoculture and their relative abundance in mixture, and by comparing polyculture performance with single-species plots. Although we found a positive relationship between production in monoculture and dominance in mixtures as predicted by the SEH, the relationship had low explanatory power. Counter to predictions, the species with the highest monoculture biomass were not able to strongly dominate all mixtures; instead the dominance of these species decreased with increasing species richness. On average, polycultures did not achieve greater biomass than (transgressively overyield) the species in each mixture, or at each site, that was most productive in monoculture. However, mixture yields did transgressively overyield both the monoculture biomass of the dominant species in the mixtures, and the weighted average of all monocultures (non-transgressive overyielding), both of which were positively related to increasing species richness. The varying responses of different overyielding tests resulted because resource partitioning and positive interactions were often counter-balanced by selection for species with lower biomass than the highest-yielding monocultures. Judging whether or not mixtures overyield therefore depends in part upon which species is the basis for comparison. We present a new general framework for overyielding analysis where every monoculture provides a potential comparison and from which the most relevant tests can be selected.},

abstract = {Green roofs are often planted with multiple species to improve aesthetics and other ecosystem services. If diverse species mixtures contain species with phenological differences in growth and reproduction, this could enhance ecosystem functioning by increasing the duration over which a valuable process operates. Phenological complementarity describes a species mixture where plant growth or reproduction is more evenly spread over time among species than predicted by chance. Here we report general phenological patterns of growth and reproduction from the third year of a four-year modular green roof experiment involving 13 species from five life form groups, planted in mixtures and monocultures. The relationships between phenological complementarity in canopy density (a surrogate for aboveground biomass) in species mixtures and thermal and hydrological functions were determined for the fourth year of the study.Timing of peak growth occurred from May to July, differing greatly among species. Flowering times also differed among species and occurred from May to October. Six species showed variation in phenology depending on whether they were planted in monocultures or species mixtures, suggesting competitive or facilitative interactions with other species. Phenological complementarity in canopy density was observed in four of the species mixture treatments, with mixtures of species from the same life form tending to have the highest complementarity values. Phenological complementarity was weakly negatively correlated with the temporal coefficient of variation in stormwater capture, indicating the potential for greater process stability over time in complementary mixtures.},

abstract = {The establishment pattern of monocultures of 61 species common to Central European semi-natural grasslands was analysed in a field experiment. The objectives were to identify key traits for successful establishment, defined in terms of above-ground biomass production, and to characterize the degree of niche overlap with respect to the use of above-ground resources, such as light and space. Four months after sowing, 15 species reached an above-ground biomass of more than 400 g m(-2). Highly productive monocultures adopted extremely different strategies of space filling in terms of canopy height, biomass density and centre of gravity of vertical biomass distribution. Regression tree analysis identified (1) the number of seedlings and (2) a trade-off between the development of a large number of small-sized shoots of species with intensive clonal growth in contrast to the establishment of fewer large-sized shoots as the two most important traits for successful establishment. Further variables associated with high above-ground biomass production by individual species were traits known to be relevant to the relative growth rate of herbaceous species, such as specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen or allocation between shoots and roots. The principle finding of this study is that the success of the 15 most productive species was not based on a single pathway but on a variable combination of traits. There are clearly many possible combinations of morphological and physiological features that will result in a species becoming productive, and these combinations differ among species in a local species pool.},

abstract = {1. Recent studies have shown that the positive relationship between plant diversity and plant biomass ('overyielding') can be explained by soil pathogens depressing productivity more in low than in high diverse plant communities. However, tests of such soil effects in field studies were constrained by experimental limitations to manipulate soil community composition independent of plant community composition. Here, we report of an experiment where feedback effects to plants were tested for both plant and soil monocultures and mixtures. 2. Our results demonstrate that overyielding is the result of plant species in mixture being more growth-limited by 'own' soil biota than by soil biota of other plant species. This effect disappeared when the soils had been sterilized by gamma-irradiation. Mixing plants themselves did not result in overyielding except when grown in the soil of one of the species (Leucanthemum vulgare), where growth of one species disproportionally increased in mixture compared to monoculture. 3. Soil nutrient availability could not explain differences in growth between the non-sterilized soils. Therefore, our results suggest that plant species-specific soil biota rather than the plants have contributed to the plant community overyielding. 4. Species biomass ranking in mixtures highly differed between non-sterilized soils of different histories of soil conditioning, whilst the ranking was more consistent in sterilized soil. Sterilized soils of different origin differed significantly in nutrient availability. These results suggest that shifts in competitive hierarchies depend on plant species-specific interactions influenced by soil biota and cannot be induced by mineral nitrogen. 5. Synthesis. Our results show that overyielding in four plant species mixtures can be due to species-specific interactions between plants and their specific soil biota. Neither mixing the plant species alone nor the differential responses of species to mineral nitrogen influenced community productivity, but mixing soil biota did.},

abstract = {Legume species promote productivity and increase the digestibility of herbage in grasslands. Considerable experimental data also indicate that communities with legumes produce more above-ground biomass than is expected from monocultures. While it has been attributed to N facilitation, evidence to identify the mechanisms involved is still lacking and the role of complementarity in soil water acquisition by vertical root differentiation remains unclear. We used a 20-months mesocosm experiment to investigate the effects of species richness (single species, two- and five-species mixtures) and functional diversity (presence of the legume Trifolium repens) on a set of traits related to light, N and water use and measured at community level. We found a positive effect of Trifolium presence and abundance on biomass production and complementarity effects in the two-species mixtures from the second year. In addition the community traits related to water and N acquisition and use (leaf area, N, water- use efficiency, and deep root growth) were higher in the presence of Trifolium. With a multiple regression approach, we showed that the traits related to water acquisition and use were with N the main determinants of biomass production and complementarity effects in diverse mixtures. At shallow soil layers, lower root mass of Trifolium and higher soil moisture should increase soil water availability for the associated grass species. Conversely at deep soil layer, higher root growth and lower soil moisture mirror soil resource use increase of mixtures. Altogether, these results highlight N facilitation but almost soil vertical differentiation and thus complementarity for water acquisition and use in mixtures with Trifolium. Contrary to grass-Trifolium mixtures, no significant over- yielding was measured for grass mixtures even those having complementary traits (short and shallow vs. tall and deep). Thus, vertical complementarity for soil resources uptake in mixtures was not only dependant on the inherent root system architecture but also on root plasticity. We also observed a time-dependence for positive complementarity effects due to the slow development of Trifolium in mixtures, possibly induced by competition with grasses. Overall, our data underlined that soil water resource was an important driver of over-yielding and complementarity effects in Trifolium-grass mixtures.},

abstract = {Communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in five agricultural field sites of different management intensities were studied. Variable regions of the ribosomal RNA genes were used to detect and identify AMF directly within colonized roots. Roots from a continuous maize monoculture showed low AMF diversity, in agreement with previous reports on molecular diversity of AMF in agricultural soils. In contrast, a substantially higher diversity of AMF was found throughout the long term 'DOK' field experiment, where organic and conventional agricultural practices have been compared side by side since 1978. In this experiment, a 7-year crop rotation is performed under lower levels of inorganic fertilizer input and chemical pest control. These results are in good agreement with analyses of the spore community previously conducted in these field sites. In a third site, an organically managed leek field with soil of very high phosphate content reflecting the highly intensive conventional field history and intensive tillage, we detected a low-diversity community comparable to the maize monoculture. In addition to fungi from Glomus group A, which have previously been reported to dominate arable soils, we regularly found members of the genera Scutellospora, Paraglomus and Acaulospora. The genus Acaulospora was shown to occur more frequently early in the growing season, suggesting that the life history strategy of AMF may influence the active community at a given time. These data show that the diversity of AMF is not always low in arable soils. Furthermore, low-input agriculture involving crop rotation may provide better conditions to preserve AMF diversity, by preventing the selection for the few AMF taxa tolerating high nutrient levels.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Hoeber, Fransson, Prieto-Ruiz, Manzoni and Weih. Individual plant species or genotypes often differ in their demand for nutrients; to compete in a community they must be able to acquire more nutrients (i.e., uptake efficiency) and/or use them more efficiently for biomass production than their competitors. These two mechanisms are often complementary, as there are inherent trade-offs between them. In a mixed-stand, species with contrasting nutrient use patterns interact and may use their resources to increase productivity in different ways. Under contrasting nutrient availabilities, the competitive advantages conferred by either strategy may also shift, so that the interaction between resource use strategy and resource availability ultimately determines the performance of individual genotypes in mixtures. The aim was to investigate growth and nitrogen (N) use efficiency of two willow (Salix) genotypes grown in monoculture and mixture in a fertilizer contrast. We explored the hypotheses that (1) the biomass production of at least one of the involved genotypes should be greater when grown in mixture as compared to the corresponding monoculture when nutrients are the most growth-limiting factor; and (2) the N economy of individual genotypes differs when grown in mixture compared to the corresponding monoculture. The genotypes ‘Tora' (Salix schwerinii × S. viminalis) and ‘Loden' (S. dasyclados), with contrasting phenology and functional traits, were grown from cuttings in a growth container experiment under two nutrient fertilization treatments (high and low) in mono- and mixed-culture for 17 weeks. Under low nutrient level, ‘Tora' showed a higher biomass production (aboveground biomass, leaf area productivity) and N uptake efficiency in mixture than in monoculture, whereas ‘Loden' showed the opposite pattern. In addition, ‘Loden' showed higher leaf N productivity but lower N uptake efficiency than ‘Tora.' The results demonstrated that the specific functional trait combinations of individual genotypes affect their response to mixture as compared to monoculture. Plants grown in mixture as opposed to monoculture may thus increase biomass and vary in their response of N use efficiency traits. However, young plants were investigated here, and as we cannot predict mixture response in mature stands, our results need to be validated at field scale.},

abstract = {Increased incidence of drought, as predicted under climate change, has the potential to negatively affect grassland production. Compared to monocultures, vertical belowground niche complementarity between shallow- and deep-rooting species may be an important mechanism resulting in higher yields and higher resistance to drought in grassland mixtures. However, very little is known about the belowground responses in grassland systems and increased insight into these processes may yield important information both to predict the effect of future climate change and better design agricultural systems to cope with this. This study assessed the effect of a 9-week experimental summer drought on the depth of water uptake of two shallow-rooting species (Lolium perenne L. and Trifolium repens L.) and two deep-rooting species (Cichorium intybus L. and Trifolium pratense L.) in grassland monocultures and four-species mixtures by using the natural abundance $\delta$18O isotope method. We tested the following three hypotheses: (1) drought results in a shift of water uptake to deeper soil layers, (2) deep-rooting species take up a higher proportion of water from deeper soil layers relative to shallow-rooting species, and (3) as a result of interspecific interactions in mixtures, the water uptake of shallow-rooting species becomes shallower when grown together with deep-rooting species and vice versa, resulting in reduced niche overlap. The natural abundance $\delta$18O technique provided novel insights into the depth of water uptake of deep- and shallow- rooting grassland species and revealed large shifts in depth of water uptake in response to drought and interspecific interactions. Compared to control conditions, drought reduced the proportional water uptake from 0–10 cm soil depth (PCWU0–10) of L. perenne, T. repens and C. intybus in monocultures by on average 54%. In contrast, the PCWU0–10 of T. pratense in monoculture increased by 44%, and only when grown in mixture did the PCWU0–10 of T. pratense decrease under drought conditions. In line with hypothesis (2), in monoculture, the PCWU0–10 of shallow-rooting species L. perenne and T. repens was 0.53 averaged over the two drought treatments, compared to 0.16 for the deep-rooting C. intybus. Surprisingly, in monoculture, water uptake by T. pratense was shallower than for the shallow-rooting species (PCWU0–10 = 0.68). Interspecific interactions in mixtures resulted in a shift in the depth of water uptake by the different species. As hypothesised, the shallow-rooting species L. perenne and T. repens tended to become shallower, and the deep-rooting T. pratense made a dramatic shift to deeper soil layers (reduction in PCWU0–10 of 58% on average) in mixture compared to monoculture. However, these shifts did not result in a reduction in the proportional similarity of the proportional water uptake from different soil depth intervals (niche overlap) in mixtures compared to monocultures. There was no clear link between interspecific differences in depth of water uptake and the reduction of biomass production under drought compared to control conditions (drought resistance). Cichorium intybus, the species with water uptake from the deepest soil layers was one of the species most affected by drought. Interestingly, T. pratense, which was least affected by drought, also had the greatest plasticity in depth of water uptake. This suggests that there may be an indirect effect of rooting depth on drought resistance, as it determines the potential plasticity in the depth of water uptake.},

abstract = {Environmental policies in African rangelands affect development and welfare as well as environmental measures. Biodiversity is widely perceived as declining, and environments as undergoing degradation, through rural population growth and resource use. These assumptions are often underpinned by environmental discourses contesting control of natural resources, rather than by objectively measured trends and causalities. Orthodox biodiversity conservation policy advocates fortress conservation. Savanna species do better where they can disperse across wider landscapes with conservation-compatible rural land uses, rather than isolated in protected areas, but community-based conservation initiatives have been disappointing. Policies addressing land degradation, and their underlying assumptions, are subject to similar challenges. The paper outlines a natural experiment investigating biodiversity and land cover changes 1975-1995 for 100,000 km2cross-border rangeland including the Serengeti-Mara conservation areas and their buffer zones. Ecological, ethnic and micro-economic continuities make it possible to control for confounding factors and identify main drivers of change. Privatisation of formerly communal rangeland, and its conversion to commercial monoculture, have driven drastic land cover and wildlife declines in Kenya. Population growth and agropastoral land use were not significant factors. The gap between natural and social science, and western versus local understandings, needs bridging to achieve more effective environmental policy. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

After 11 years, growth and nutrition and soil properties were examined in young plantation of two indigenous tree species in Hyrcanian forests of Iran. Quercus castaneifolia C.A. Mey. (as target species) and Celtis australis L. (as native component species) were planted in five proportions (100Q, 70Q:30C, 60Q:40C, 50Q:50C, 40Q:60C) in Noor, Iran. Diameter at breast height of individual Quercus trees and total basal area were affected by the presence of Celtis. Percent retranslocation of nutrients in Quercus followed in order: K> P> N. Leaf-litter fall production ranged from 4.10 to 6.141 ha-1 year-1. Ca and Mg concentrations in fully expanded leaves of Quercus, N and K retranslocation of Quercus, concentration of available P in soil were higher in some of the mixed plantations than in monoculture of Quercus. On the other hand, N concentration in fully expanded leaves of Quercus, N fluxes and soil C/N ratio were higher in monoculture of Quercus. Within the framework of this experiment, it appeared that production was maximized when these two species were grown together in the proportion of 60% Quercus and 40% Celtis.},

abstract = {Community persistence, or the ability of a community to maintain species composition and diversity through time, is a component of stability that is important to restoration. We ran a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment for three years, and then stopped weeding it for 5-6 years, which allowed us to test whether increased plant species diversity and dissimilarity in height would lead to increased community persistence in the face of high invasion pressure by non-native species. Our approach was unique in that the experiment varied richness (one or four species) and evenness (three levels plus monocultures of the dominant species) using two separate dissimilarity types (having all tall species or having tall and short species combined) in six spatiotemporal blocks. Persistence was quantified as to how well positive productivity-diversity relationships, proportion of planted native species, and species richness remained unchanged over time. Thus, high persistence values indicate low levels of invasion and local extinction. We found that the positive relationship between diversity measures and productivity persisted after cessation of weeding. The proportion of planted species was 32% higher in mixture than in monoculture plots, indicating that monocultures were more heavily invaded by non-native species. Reduced evenness did not affect persistence measures in plots with dissimilar heights, but measures declined linearly with decreased evenness in plots with all tall species. Our results suggest that (1) persistence-diversity relationships are likely to vary with the traits of species becoming rare and going extinct, and (2) it is important to restore higher species diversity in restoration projects to favor the long-term persistence of planted species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Gesellschaft fU{double grave}r U{double grave}kologie.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Despite experimental evidence for effects of primary producer diversity and consumer species diversity on population and community processes, little is known about how diversity at these multiple trophic levels may interact. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to examine the independent and interactive effects of seagrass Zostera marina genotypic diversity and grazer species diversity on seagrass, epiphyte, and grazer responses. There were no interactions between seagrass genotypic diversity and grazer species diversity, per se; however, the effects of seagrass genotypic diversity on both seagrass and grazer biomass depended on grazer species identity. In particular, seagrass biomass was higher in polyculture than in monoculture, but only when the sea hare Phyllaplysia taylori was the only grazer present. This enhanced growth was due to complementarity among genotypes in the presence of P. taylori. Seagrass genotypic diversity effects on grazer biomass and fecundity were small and/or idiosyncratic, yet grazer species composition had a large impact on grazer reproductive effort. Only grazer species identity, and not seagrass genotypic diversity or grazer species diversity, affected epiphyte biomass, consistent with other findings of the importance of species identity. Our results confirm the effects of seagrass genetic diversity on the plant itself as well as the grazer species that utilize it for both food and habitat. Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of grazers for controlling epiphyte and seagrass biomass.},

Seagrass systems provide some of the best evidence for the ecological effects of genetic diversity among adult shoots, but we do not know if the genetic diversity of seeds and seedlings also influences seagrass ecology. We tested the effects of seagrass (Zostera marina) seed diversity and relatedness on germination success, seedling morphology, and seedling production by comparing experimental assemblages of seeds collected from single reproductive shoots (“monocultures”) to assemblages of seeds collected from multiple reproductive shoots (“polycultures”). There was no difference in seedling emergence, yet seedlings from polycultures had larger shoots above and below ground than seedlings from monocultures at the end of the 1-yr experiment. Genetic relatedness of the seedlings predicted some aspects of shoot morphology, with more leaves and longer roots and shoots at intermediate levels of relatedness, regardless of seed diversity. Our results suggest that studies of only adult stages may underestimate the importance of genetic diversity if the benefits at early life history stages continue to accrue throughout the life cycle.},

abstract = {1. Genetic diversity, like species diversity, can enhance resistance or resilience to perturbation. However, we know little about how disturbance intensity affects this relationship or what mechanisms underlie the positive effects of genetic diversity. 2. We experimentally tested the independent and interactive effects of seagrass genotypic diversity (two levels) and disturbance (three levels) on seagrass biomass in a 2-year field experiment. 3. Our results indicate that genotypic diversity enhances seagrass resilience from experimental biomass removal, but only at the highest level of disturbance; in the absence of disturbance, monocultures out-perform polycultures over the short term. 4. Following recovery from the planned experimental disturbance, a natural macroalgal bloom caused a loss of seagrass shoots in our plots. In this case polycultures lost fewer shoots than monocultures (i.e. were more resistant to the disturbance), and this positive effect of genetic diversity persisted until the end of the experiment (1 year in total, including 6 months after all plots had recovered to pre-disturbance densities). At the end of the 2-year experiment, polycultures had higher shoot density and above-ground biomass than monocultures. 5. The positive effects of diversity on shoot density and biomass were caused by both trait-independent complementarity (TIC; due to differential resource use among clones) and positive dominance (due to one genotype achieving high density in both monoculture and polyculture). 6.Synthesis. Our results confirm that genetic diversity, like species diversity, can influence disturbance response and does so via similar mechanisms. They also highlight that over longer time frames, these effects are likely to result from a complex mix of dominance and complementarity mechanisms that depend on the traits of the specific taxa involved and the response variables of interest.},

We examined if grass/forb/legume mixtures combining species with complementary vertical and temporal nutrient capture further promote nutrient yields and improve fertilizer N recovery. Methods Four species differing in N2-fixing ability and in vertical and temporal nutrient capture were grown in monoculture and two- and four-species mixtures. 15N was used to examine vertical complementarity in nutrient capture and fertilizer N recovery. Asynchrony was quan- tified from the N yield distribution over the year. Results The positive mixture effects on N and P yields (P < 0.001) between species contrasting in vertical and temporal nutrient capture (with same N2-fixing ability) were of a similar magnitude (+45 kg N) as those be- tween N2-fixing and non-fixing species with shallow roots (+52 kg N). Mixture benefits were maximized up to +99 kg N when constituent species differed in N2- fixing ability and vertical and temporal nutrient capture. Speciesmodified their verticalNcapture when grown in mixture (niche shift). Remarkably, mixing Trifolium pratense and Cichorium intybus, which were similar in both vertical and temporal nutrient capture, generated negative mixture effects. The 4-species mixture cap- tured as much fertilizer N as the grass monoculture, despite significant abundance of legumes. Conclusions Combining species differing in multiple characteristics for nutrient capture optimizes nutrient capture of non-legume/legume-mixtures.},

Furthermore, we need to identify and better understand the factors that influence species and community yielding behaviors because the general conditions for overyielding are the same as those for coexistence. We established experimental tallgrass prairie plots in Iowa to determine how two ecologically realistic rarityextinction scenarios influenced aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and disassembly. Equal-mass seedlings of six tallgrass prairie species were transplanted into field plots to establish realistic declining species evenness (high, medium, low) and richness (4, 1) treatments. Across declining evenness treatments, the relative abundance of the ubiquitous tall species Andropogon gerardii increased, the relative abundance of the tall species Salvia azurea was constant, and the relative abundance of two short (dissimilar height scenario) or two tall species (tall scenario) decreased. Monocultures of Andropogon represented a continuation of this trend until there was complete dominance by Andropogon and extinction of all other species. Our treatments also allowed us to test if variation in plant height contributes to the complementarity effect. Niche partitioning in plant height was not positively related to complementarity. The effects of declining species evenness and richness on the diversityproductivity relationship were different for these two ecologically realistic rarityextinction scenarios. Specifically, as diversity declined across treatments, ANPP and the selection effects decreased in tall communities, but not in dissimilar communities. Additionally, differences between these two scenarios revealed that decreased species yielding behavior is associated with two tallgrass prairie extinction risk factors, rarity and short height. The differences between these scenarios demonstrate the importance of incorporating the known patterns of diversity declines into future studies.},

abstract = {Exotic-dominated ecosystems with low diversity are becoming increasingly common. It remains unclear, though, whether differences between native and exotic species (driver model), or changes in disturbances or resources (passenger model), allow exotics to become competitive dominants. In our field experiment, plant species origin (native or exotic), cattle grazing (ungrazed or intensely grazed once), and species composition treatments were fully crossed and randomly assigned to four-species mixtures and monocultures of grassland plants. We found that biodiversity declined more rapidly in exotic than in native species mixtures, regardless of our grazing disturbance treatment. Early declines in species evenness (i.e., increases in dominance) led to subsequent declines in species richness (i.e., local extinctions) in exotic mixtures. Specifically, Simpson's diversity was 29% lower after 1 year, and species richness was 15% lower after 3 years, in exotic than in native mixtures. These rapid biodiversity declines in exotic mixtures were partly explained by decreased complementarity (i.e., niche partitioning and facilitation), presumably because exotic species lack the coevolutionary history that can lead to complementarity and coexistence in native communities. Thus, our results suggest that exotic species can drive biodiversity declines in the presence or absence of a grazing disturbance, partly because exotic species interactions differ from native species interactions. This implies that restoring plant biodiversity in grasslands may require removal of exotic species, in addition to disturbance management},

abstract = {1. The risk of pest damage in forest monocultures is a growing concern as the area of plantation forest expands world-wide and sustainable management is becoming a general goal. Numerous studies have demonstrated that pest insects are less abundant in more diverse agroecosystems, but limited experimental evidence exists for a similar relationship in forestry. Because plantation forests are usually mosaics of single-species stands, the aim of this study was to test the effect of forest diversity at a landscape level on pest insect infestations. 2. Within a stand of maritime pine, trees attacked by the stem borer Dioryctria sylvestrella showed no spatial aggregation and clusters of 66 trees proved to be an optimal sampling unit for determining overall percentage infestation. 3. The spatial distribution of stem borer infestation levels was examined in three maritime pine stands bordered by mixed-species stands of broad-leaved trees, and overall infestation levels compared between four such maritime pine stands and four other maritime pine stands of the same structure but far from any broad-leaved stands. 4. The percentage of trees infested was significantly lower in the pine stands bordered by broad-leaved stands than in the pine stands surrounded by other pine stands, and in the former, stem borer infestation showed a significant logistic increase with distance from the stand edge. This could be due to effects of resource concentration or natural enemy attack, both of which are discussed. 5. These results suggest that the conservation or restoration of non-productive mixed-species stands adjacent to intensively managed plantations is a useful preventive method for pest management in forest monocultures.},

abstract = {Issue Title: IASWS 2011: The Interactions between Sediments and Water Bioturbation is a major process influencing the functioning of benthic ecosystems. Although controlled experiments with species in monoculture or in artificial combinations have increased the knowledge about the role of biological diversity on geochemical processes, specific interactions have been neglected, making the extrapolation of experimental results to natural systems difficult. In this context, the main objective of this study was to measure the effects of a whole natural macrobenthic community on benthic oxygen uptake. The relationships between macrofauna and oxygen uptakes were investigated in the estuarine system of the Seine, France, during the winter and fall according to the variability of river discharge. Four undisturbed sediment cores with associated macrofauna and overlying water were sampled at nine subtidal stations in order to perform whole core incubations and measure total oxygen uptake (TOU). Moreover, values of diffusive oxygen uptake (DOU) were obtained using microelectrode profiling and fauna-mediated oxygen uptake (FOU) was calculated as the difference between TOU and DOU. FOUs were thus linked to macrofaunal parameters; both traditional (species richness, abundance and biomass) and functional (trophic guilds and bioturbation modes). The average FOU (±SD) ranged from 170±36 to 1,324±701 $\mu$mol m^sup -2^ h^sup -1^, and values represented 33 to 89 % of TOU. Each of the traditional macrofauna parameters had a significant and positive correlation with FOU. In addition, abundance, biomass and species number of some functional groups (e.g. suspension feeders and biodiffusors) were also correlated to FOU, supporting the diversity-stability hypothesis of McArthur (Ecology 36:533-536, 1955). Nevertheless, the relationship between FOU and other functional groups such as conveyors illustrated the idiosyncratic nature of this hypothesis, underlining the difficulty of clearly identifying the role of a macrofaunal community on oxygen exchanges at the sediment-water interface. Our results confirm the importance of functional biodiversity on mineralization processes as well as the need to take into account the whole community. They also suggest that future studies should focus on the functional consequences of species loss and the potential resilience of the communities as a way to maintain ecosystem processes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Litter often decomposes faster in its environment of origin (at 'home') than in a foreign environment ('away'), which has become known as the home-field advantage (HFA). However, many studies have highlighted the conditional nature of the HFA, suggesting that current understanding of this phenomenon is not yet sufficient to generalize across systems. METHODS The HFA hypothesis was tested for mono-specific and mixed-species litter using a tree-based experiment that manipulated the functional identity and diversity of the host tree community. Litter types of varying quality were transplanted between several host tree communities and decomposition rates were measured using litterbags. Since the decomposer community should respond to traits of the litter input and not their taxonomic identity, a traits-based index of litter-tree similarity was developed. KEY RESULTS Mono-specific litter exhibited HFA, but when the same litter was decomposed in mixture, this trend was not observed. Mixed-species litter decomposed on average no faster or slower than monoculture litter and exhibited both positive and negative species interactions. These non-additive interactions of decomposition rates in mixture were influenced by the degree of similarity between litter and tree traits. Both synergistic and antagonistic interactions decreased in magnitude with increasing litter-tree similarity such that mixture rates were predictable from monocultures. CONCLUSIONS The HFA occurred more strongly for mono-specific litter than for the litter types mixed together because interactions between species may have masked this effect. However, when expressed as a function of trait similarity between litters and tree communities, the HFA was not detected.},

abstract = {Litter, as afterlife of plants, plays an important role in driving belowground decomposition processes. Here we tested effects of litter species identity and diversity on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics during litter decomposition in N-limited alpine meadow soil from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We incubated litters of four meadow species, a sedge ("S", Kobresia humilis), a grass ("G", Elymus nutans), a herb ("H", Saussurea superba), and a legume ("L", Oxytropis falcata), in monoculture and in mixture with meadow soil. CO2 release was measured 21 times during the incubation, and soil available N and microbial biomass C and N were measured before and after the experiment. The organic C decay rate did not differ much among soils amended with monocultures or mixtures of litter, except in the H, S, L, and S+H treatments, which had much higher decay rates. Potential decomposable C pools were lowest in the control, highest in the L treatment, and intermediate in the S treatment. Mineralized N was completely immobilized by soil microbes in all treatments except the control, S+L, and S+G+L treatments. Litter mixtures had both additive and non-additive effects on CO2-C emission (mainly antagonistic effects), net N mineralization (mainly synergistic), and microbial biomass C and N (both). Overall, these parameters were not significantly correlated with litter species richness. Similarly, microbial C or N was not significantly correlated with litter N content or C/N. However, cumulative CO2-C emission and net N mineralization were positively correlated with litter N content and negatively correlated with litter C/N. Litter N content and C/N rather than litter species richness drove the release of CO2-C and net available N in this ecosystem. The antagonistic effects of litter mixtures contributed to a modest release of CO2-C, but their synergistic effects enhanced net available N. We suggest that in alpine meadow communities, balancing species with high and low N contents will benefit soil carbon sequestration and plant competition for available N with soil microbes.},

abstract = {Although much research aiming to determine in what ways aboveground systems may affect belowground processes and communities has been conducted, the effects of litter mixing on decomposition processes and decomposer communities remain controversial. In this study, a litter mixing experiment was conducted using litterbags in a Pinus koraiensis mixed broad-leaved forest of the Changbai Mountains, in which the treatments consisted of litter monocultures of each of four canopy tree species, namely P. koraiensis, Fraxinus mandshurica, Tilia amurensis and Acer mono, as well as mixtures of two and four different species. It was found that the different litter species decomposed in monoculture at different rates. The litter mixing had idiosyncratic effects on the decomposition, which depended on the field incubation time and composition species. Litter species identity was an important determinant of abundances and diversity of soil fauna, while litter mixing had weak or no significant effects on the soil fauna communities. The study results also showed that soil fauna has an important influence on litter decomposition; however, the extent of the relationship between decomposition and soil fauna was not stronger in the litter mixtures than in the monocultures. It is concluded that litter mixing had effects on decomposition, with relatively minor effects on soil fauna communities in comparison to the effects of litter species identity. ?? 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Many studies that provided evidence for a positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity have proposed that this effect may be explained by complementarity among species in resources utilization, or selection of particularly productive species in high-diversity plant communities. Recent studies have related the higher productivity in diverse plant communities to suppression of pathogenic soil biota. If soil biota plays a role in diversity–productivity relationships, the question remains about how they may influence complementarity and selection effects. Here we examine how complementarity and selection effects may depend on soil biota using a plant–soil feedback approach. We used monocultures and mixtures of early successional plant species, which are known to have mostly negative plant–soil feedback effects, and mid-successional plant species, which generally have neutral plant–soil feedback. We found that plant–soil feedback effects differed between monocultures and mixed plant communities, as well as between early and mid-successional plants. This resulted in a significant interaction effect between diversity and successional stage. In monocultures, plant–soil feedback tended to be negative for early and positive for mid-successional plant species. Interestingly, the community feedback responses of the mixed communities were opposite, being positive for early and negative for mid-successional community. Plant–soil feedback differentially affected complementarity and selection effects of early and mid-successional plant communities: it enhanced complementarity effects of early and decreased selection effects of mid-successional species. Synthesis. Soil biota that drive plant–soil feedback effects can influence the diversity–productivity relationship not only through decreased biomass production in monocultures compared to mixtures, but also through influencing complementarity and selection effects among species in mixed plant communities. Our results reveal that biodiversity–productivity relationships depend on plant–soil feedback interactions, which depend on the successional position of the plant. We propose that including successional position and trait-based analyses of plant–soil feedback in diversity-functioning studies will enhance understanding consequences of biodiversity loss for productivity and other ecosystem processes.},

We tested this hypothesis in a field experiment by manipulating patches of Evening Primrose (Oenothera biennis) to contain one, four or eight plant genotypes. We then surveyed 92 species of naturally colonizing arthropods. Genetically diverse plant patches had 18% more arthropod species, and a greater abundance of omnivorous and predacious arthropods, but not herbivores, compared with monocultures. The effects of genotypic diversity on arthropod communities were due to a combination of interactive and additive effects among genotypes within genetically diverse patches. Greater genetic diversity also led to a selective feedback, as mean genotype fitness was 27% higher in diverse patches than in monocultures. A comparison between our results and the literature reveals that genetic diversity and species diversity can have similar qualitative and quantitative effects on arthropod communities. Our findings also illustrate the benefit of preserving genetic variation to conserve species diversity and interactions within multitrophic communities.},

abstract = {Ecosystem consequences of biodiversity change are often studied from a species loss perspective, while the effects of invasive species on ecosystem functions are rarely quantified. In this experimental study, we used isotope tracers to measure the incorporation and burial of carbon and nitrogen from a simulated spring phytoplankton bloom by communities of one to four species of deposit-feeding macrofauna found in the species-poor Baltic Sea. The recently invading polychaete Marenzelleria arctia, which has spread throughout the Baltic Sea, grows more rapidly than the native species Monoporeia affinis, Pontoporeia femorata (both amphipods) and Macoma balthica (a bivalve), resulting in higher biomass increase (biomass production) in treatments including the polychaete. Marenzelleria incorporated and buried bloom material at rates similar to the native species. Multi-species treatments generally had higher isotope incorporation, indicative of utilization of bloom material, than expected from monoculture yields of the respective species. The mechanism behind this observed over-yielding was mainly niche complementarity in utilization of the bloom input, and was more evident in communities including the invader. In contrast, multi-species treatments had generally lower biomass increase than expected. This contrasting pattern suggests that there is little overlap in resource use of freshly deposited bloom material between Marenzelleria and the native species but it is likely that interference competition acts to dampen resulting community biomass. In conclusion, an invasive species can enhance incorporation and burial of organic matter from settled phytoplankton blooms, two processes fundamental for marine productivity.},

abstract = {AimsInvasive species continue to be a worldwide threat to ecosystems mainly as a cause for biodiversity loss. Forest ecosystems, for example, are subject to a change in species composition due to the invasion of exotic species. Specifying the attributes that cause the strong competitiveness of several exotic species may improve the ability to understand and effectively manage plant invasions in the future. In this study the following hypotheses were tested: (1) biomass production of below- and aboveground plant components of the exotic tree species is higher than that of the natives, resulting in a higher competitiveness of the exotics; (2) the exclusion of root competition has a positive effect on the biomass production of the inferior native species; and (3) mixtures of native and exotic species yield a higher biomass production than the respective monocultures. MethodsA pot experiment, containing about 2000 tree seedlings, was established. We investigated the biomass productivity and growth reactions of two native (Quercus robur L., Carpinus betulus L.) and two exotic tree species (Prunus serotina Ehrh., Robinia pseudoacacia L.) in different intra- and interspecific, competitive situations with and without the influence of root competition. Important FindingsThe biomass production of both exotic species was significantly higher and led to a strong competitive advantage, resulting in a biomass decrease of the less competitive native species. The high belowground biomass of both exotic species had a negative effect on the biomass production. The competitive pressure of exotic tree seedlings on the native ones was largely driven by root competition. Furthermore, mixtures of native and exotic tree species had a higher productivity than their growth in monocultures would have predicted. Competition was lower for exotic species in mixtures with the less productive native species compared to the competition in monocultures or in mixture with the other highly productive exotic species. Accordingly, both highly competitive exotic species produced less biomass in mixture with each other compared to monocultures. Despite the significantly higher biomass of P. serotina in all mixtures and in monoculture, R. pseudoacacia seemed to be the dominating species. Due to its strong root competition, R. pseudoacacia significantly reduced the biomass production of P. serotina.},

abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been replaced by homogeneous tree monocultures with potentially drastic effect on ecological interactions. We expect that ecologically-managed tree monocultures, however, can help to mitigate this impact. Here, we carried out an experiment with Inga vera (Fabaceae), an extrafloral nectary bearing plant, to test if the efficiency of ants as anti-herbivory defense is affected by the replacement of its natural habitat (Araucaria Forest) by ecologically-managed tree monocultures (plantations of Araucaria, Pinus, and Eucalyptus). Seedlings of Inga vera were transplanted to three patches of each habitat and ants were excluded from half of the plants. The abundance of ants and herbivores was low, similar among habitats, and exhibited temporal asynchrony. Number of herbivores and accumulated herbivory levels were lower in plant with ants. Rates of herbivory were extremely low and lower for young leaves than for mature leaves. The presence of ants did not affect plant performance traits measured by their growth in height, and their final numbers of leaves and leaflets. Contrary to what might be expected, ant-protected plants produced fewer leaves and leaflets than unprotected ones. In conclusion, Inga vera-ant interaction was similar between its natural habitat and the tree monocultures, indicating that potentially both species diversity and ecological processes can be conserved in ecologically-managed tree monocultures.

abstract = {Changes in livestock production systems have led to land-use changes and abandonment, especially of semi-natural grassland in agriculturally less favoured regions. The generation of energy from biomass of extensive, high-diversity grasslands can be an alternative to their abandonment, and anaerobic digestion is one possible method for converting grassland biomass into energy. However, little is known about the effects of species richness (SR) and functional groups on chemical constituents relevant for anaerobic digestion and the resulting energy potential. In this study, changes in the herbage chemical constituents that are relevant for forage quality were studied along a well-defined diversity gradient (one to sixty species) and across different combinations of functional groups (legumes, small herbs, tall herbs and grasses). Substrate-specific methane yield (CH4 sub) was estimated through the concentrations of forage-quality parameters such as crude fibre (CF), crude protein (CP), crude lipid, nitrogen-free extract and their documented digestibility values, as well as the respective methane yields. Results show that with increasing SR, the CF increased and CP decreased, even though these effects could not be fully disentangled from the presence of grasses. These trends led to a negative effect of SR on CH4 sub, while the area-specific methane yield (CH4 area = CH4 sub × biomass yield) increased due to a strong increase in biomass with increasing SR. The CH4 sub was increased when legumes were present, and it declined with the presence of grasses. Generally, CH4 sub and CH4 area varied between functional-group monocultures and all functional-group mixtures.},

The combustion of mature and fibrous biomass, as occurs in extensive grasslands managed with low cutting frequencies, is one possible conver- sion technique. This study tested the relationship between plant diversity and biomass constituents rele- vant for combustion, as they determine energy con- tent, energy yield and emission and corrosion risks. The biomass from a biodiversity experiment, with a species richness (SR) gradient of 1–60 species from Central European mesophilic grasslands divided into four functional groups (grasses, legumes, small and tall herbs), was harvested twice a year (in 2008 and 2009). The higher heating value (HHV) was estimated from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen contents to give insight into the energy potential of the species mix- tures. The potential risk of emission and corrosion was assessed by analysing ash content, potassium, calcium, magnesium, nitrogen, sulphur and chloride content. HHV was independent of SR, and the overall mean was 18{\textperiodcentered}13 MJ kg?1 DM. Biomass and gross energy (GE) yield were positively affected by SR. The pres- ence of legumes in a mixture resulted in increased HHV, biomass yield and GE, irrespective of the level of SR. Annual GE varied between 59 (average of monocultures) and 152 GJ ha?1 year?1 (mixture of sixty species). The concentration of ash-forming ele- ments was generally high, suggesting a pre-treatment of the biomass prior to combustion.

abstract = {Studies of biodiversity–ecosystem function in treed ecosystems have generally focused on aboveground functions. This study investigates intertrophic links between tree diversity and soil microbial community function and composition. We examined how microbial communities in surface mineral soil responded to experimental gradients of tree species richness (SR), functional diversity (FD), community-weighted mean trait value (CWM), and tree identity. The site was a 4-year-old common garden experiment near Montreal, Canada, consisting of deciduous and evergreen tree species mixtures. Microbial community composition, community-level physiological profiles, and respiration were evaluated using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and the MicroResp™ system, respectively. The relationship between tree species richness and glucose-induced respiration (GIR), basal respiration (BR), metabolic quotient (qCO2) followed a positive but saturating shape. Microbial communities associated with species mixtures were more active (basal respiration [BR]), with higher biomass (glucose-induced respiration [GIR]), and used a greater number of carbon sources than monocultures. Communities associated with deciduous tree species used a greater number of carbon sources than those associated with evergreen species, suggesting a greater soil carbon storage capacity. There were no differences in microbial composition (PLFA) between monocultures and SR mixtures. The FD and the CWM of several functional traits affected both BR and GIR. In general, the CWM of traits had stronger effects than did FD, suggesting that certain traits of dominant species have more effect on ecosystem processes than does FD. Both the functions of GIR and BR were positively related to aboveground tree community productivity. Both tree diversity (SR) and identity (species and functional identity—leaf habit) affected soil microbial community respiration, biomass, and composition. For the first time, we identified functional traits related to life-history strategy, as well as root traits that influence another trophic level, soil microbial community function, via effects on BR and GIR.},

abstract = {Many trees species form symbiotic associations with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which improve nutrient and water acquisition of their host. Until now it is unclear whether the species richness of ECM fungi is beneficial for tree seedling performance, be it during moist conditions or drought. We performed a pot experiment using Pinus sylvestris seedlings inoculated with four selected ECM fungi (Cenococcum geophilum, Paxillus involutus, Rhizopogon roseolus and Suillus granulatus) to investigate (i) whether these four ECM fungi, in monoculture or in species mixtures, affect growth of P. sylvestris seedlings, and (ii) whether this effect can be attributed to species number per se or to species identity. Two different watering regimes (moist vs. dry) were applied to examine the context-dependency of the results. Additionally, we assessed the activity of eight extracellular enzymes in the root tips. Shoot growth was enhanced in the presence of S. granulatus, but not by any other ECM fungal species. The positive effect of S. granulatus on shoot growth was more pronounced under moist (threefold increase) than under dry conditions (twofold increase), indicating that the investigated ECM fungi did not provide additional support during drought stress. The activity of secreted extracellular enzymes was higher in S. granulatus than in any other species. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ECM fungal species composition may affect seedling performance in terms of aboveground biomass.},

abstract = {1 Ecological and agronomic research suggests that increased crop diversity in species-poor intensive systems may improve their provision of ecosystem services. Such general predictions can have critical importance for worldwide food production and agricultural practice but are largely untested at higher levels of diversity.2 We propose new methodology for the design and analysis of experiments to quantify diversity-function relationships. Our methodology can quantify the relative strength of inter-specific interactions that contribute to a functional response, and can disentangle the separate contributions of species richness and relative abundance.3 Applying our methodology to data from a common experiment at 28 European sites, we show that the above-ground biomass of four-species mixtures (two legumes and two grasses) in intensive grassland systems was consistently greater than that expected from monoculture performance, even at high productivity levels. The magnitude of this effect generally resulted in transgressive overyielding.4 A combined analysis of first-year results across sites showed that the additional performance of mixtures was driven by the number and strength of pairwise inter-specific interactions and the evenness of the community. In general, all pairwise interactions contributed equally to the additional performance of mixtures; the grass-grass and legume-legume interactions were as strong as those between grasses and legumes.5 The combined analysis across geographical and temporal scales in our study provides a generality of interpretation of our results that would not have been possible from individual site analyses or experimentation at a single site.6 Our four-species agricultural grassland communities have proved a simple yet relevant model system for experimentation and development of methodology in diversity-function research. Our study establishes that principles derived from biodiversity research in extensive, semi-natural grassland systems are applicable in intensively managed grasslands with agricultural plant species.},

abstract = {The importance of species diversity to emergent, ecological properties of communities is increasingly appreciated, but the importance of within-species genetic diversity for analogous emergent properties of populations is only just becoming apparent. Here, the properties and effects of genetic variation on predation resistance in populations were assessed and the molecular mechanism underlying these emergent effects was investigated. Using biofilms of the ubiquitous bacterium Serratia marcescens, we tested the importance of genetic diversity in defending biofilms against protozoan grazing, a main source of mortality for bacteria in all natural ecosystems. S. marcescens biofilms established from wild-type cells produce heritable, stable variants, which when experimentally combined, persist as a diverse assemblage and are significantly more resistant to grazing than either wild type or variant biofilms grown in monoculture. This diversity effect is biofilm-specific, a result of either facilitation or resource partitioning among variants, with equivalent experiments using planktonic cultures and grazers resulting in dominance by a single resistant strain. The variants studied are all the result of single nucleotide polymorphisms in one regulatory gene suggesting that the benefits of genetic diversity in clonal biofilms can occur through remarkably minimal genetic change. The findings presented here provide a new insight on the integration of genetics and population ecology, in which diversity arising through minimal changes in genotype can have major ecological implications for natural populations.},

Because the long agricultural history has changed the physical, chemical and biological features of the soil, afforested fields can harbor novel species assemblages and interactions. Our overall aim was to quantify the diversity of ground beetles and ants in early successional afforested fields. In a large scale field experiment, we compared plots that had been afforested 25. years ago by planting monocultures of birch, pine or spruce trees. A total of 4080 carabid individuals representing 41 species, and 131,933 ant individuals representing 15 species were recorded. Both the carabid and ant assemblage included forest and open-habitat species, but were dominated by generalists, which is typical for early successional habitats. Tree species had a strong influence on carabid and ant assemblages. Species composition among pine plots was more homogeneous than among spruce or birch plots. The diversity of ground beetles and ants increased from pine to spruce to birch plots, most likely due to positive influence of leaf litter. Our results indicate that early successional afforested fields can harbor species rich arthropod assemblages. The diversity and species composition of these assemblages are influenced by tree species, already at early successional stages, and are likely to become more prominent as succession proceeds. Thus, the tree species used in afforestation is one important factor for consideration, if field afforestation has biodiversity objectives.},

abstract = {There is considerable evidence that both plant diversity and plant identity can influence the level of predation and predator abundance aboveground. However, how the level of predation in the soil and the abundance of predatory soil fauna are related to plant diversity and identity remains largely unknown. In a biodiversity field experiment, we examined the effects of plant diversity and identity on the infectivity of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs, Heterorhabditis and Steinernema spp.), which prey on soil arthropods, and abundance of carnivorous non-EPNs, which are predators of other nematode groups. To obtain a comprehensive view of the potential prey/food availability, we also quantified the abundance of soil insects and nonpredatory nematodes and the root biomass in the experimental plots. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate possible pathways by which plant diversity and identity may affect EPN infectivity and the abundance of carnivorous non-EPNs. Heterorhabditis spp. infectivity and the abundance of carnivorous non-EPNs were not directly related to plant diversity or the proportion of legumes, grasses and forbs in the plant community. However, Steinernema spp. infectivity was higher in monocultures of Festuca rubra and Trifolium pratense than in monocultures of the other six plant species. SEM revealed that legumes positively affected Steinernema infectivity, whereas plant diversity indirectly affected the infectivity of HeterorhabditisEPNs via effects on the abundance of soil insects. The abundance of prey (soil insects and root-feeding, bacterivorous, and fungivorous nematodes) increased with higher plant diversity. The abundance of prey nematodes was also positively affected by legumes. These plant community effects could not be explained by changes in root biomass. Our results show that plant diversity and identity effects on belowground biota (particularly soil nematode community) can differ between organisms that belong to the same feeding guild and that generalizations about plant diversity effects on soil organisms should be made with great caution.},

abstract = {1. Plant genotypic diversity has important consequences for a variety of ecosystem processes, yet empirical evidence for its effects on productivity, one of the most fundamental of these processes, is lacking. In addition, the performance of insect herbivores in response to high genotypic diversity is unknown, despite previous work demonstrating differential herbivore performance among plant genotypes. 2. We manipulated genotypic diversity of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana in both the presence and absence of the generalist herbivore Trichoplusia ni under semi-natural growth conditions. We used nine genotypes (eight ecotypes and one mutant) of A. thaliana known to differ widely in functional traits. Productivity and insect biomass were measured in monocultures and mixtures of all nine genotypes grown at multiple fertilization levels and planting densities. 3. In both the absence and presence of herbivores, genotypic diversity increased plant productivity and survival. This effect was, for the most part, independent of fertility or density. Sampling or selection effects did not appear to be wholly responsible for these results as all genotypes were maintained in equal proportion and no single genotype became dominant for the duration of the experiment. 4. High diversity increased T. ni biomass and survival in all treatments. Insect biomass was positively, but not tightly, correlated to plant biomass, indicating that the higher herbivore performance observed in genotypic mixtures was only partially due to higher productivity. 5.Synthesis. Our data support the idea that even within a single plant species, genotypic diversity can exert strong influences on both the producer and herbivore communities. The exact mechanisms responsible for these effects and the relative importance of genotypic diversity in natural communities warrant further investigation.},

abstract = {We studied the effect of forest tree species on a community of decomposers that colonize cellulose strips. Both fungal and bacterial communities were targeted in a native forest dominated by beech and oak and 30-year-old beech and spruce plantations, growing in similar ecological conditions in the Breuil-Chenue experimental forest site in Morvan (France). Microbial ingrowths from the 3rd to 10th month of strip decomposition (May to December 2004) were studied. Community composition was assessed using temperature gradient gel electrophoresis with universal fungal (ITS1F, ITS2) and bacterial (1401r, 968f) primers. Soil temperature and moisture as well as fungal biomass were also measured to give additional information on decomposition processes. Changing the dominant tree species had no significant influence in the number of decomposer species. However, decomposer community composition was clearly different. If compared to the native forest, where community composition highly differed, young monocultures displayed similar species structure for fungi and bacteria. Both species numbers and community composition evolved during the decay process. Time effect was found to be more important than tree species. Nevertheless, the actual environmental conditions and seasonal effect seemed to be even more determining factors for the development of microbial communities. The course and correlations of the explored variables often differed between tree species, although certain general trends were identified. Fungal biomass was high in summer, despite that species richness (SR) decreased and conversely, that high SR did not necessarily mean high biomass values. It can be concluded that the growth and development of the microbiological communities that colonized a model material in situ depended on the combination of physical and biological factors acting collectively and interdependently at the forest soil microsite.},

abstract = {Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) have gained attention for their role in plant community dynamics, but their role in productivity has been overlooked. We developed and tested a biomass-specific, multi-species model to examine the role of PSFs in diversity-productivity relationships. The model predicts a negative relationship between PSFs and overyielding: plants with negative PSFs grow more in communities than in monoculture (i.e. overyield), and plants with positive PSFs grow less in communities than in monoculture (i.e. underyield). This effect is predicted to increase with diversity and saturate at low species richness because the proportion of 'self-cultivated' soils rapidly decreases as species are added to a community. Results in a set of glasshouse experiments supported model predictions. We found that PSFs measured in one experiment were negatively correlated with overyielding in three-species plant communities measured in a separate experiment. Furthermore, when parametrized with our experimental PSF data, our model successfully predicted species-level overyielding and underyielding. The model was less effective at predicting community-level overyielding and underyielding, although this appeared to reflect large differences between communities with or without nitrogen-fixing plants. Results provide conceptual and experimental support for the role of PSFs in diversity-productivity relationships.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this review, we present the current knowledge of drought resistance of tropical mixed species plantations and summarize preliminary evidence from a tree biodiversity experiment in Panama. Converting mono-specific stands into mixed ones may improve stand stability and might reduce increasing abiotic and biotic disturbances due to climate change. However, little is known about the extent to which tropical tree species or tropical tree communities can resist increasing disturbances in the short term, e.g., water limitations due to increasing dry season intensity or length, or about their resilience after such disturbances and their capacity to adapt to changing conditions in the long term. Studies relating drought resistance and resilience to community diversity are missing. Further, we highlight the urgent need for a multifactorial manipulative throughfall reduction experiment in tropical environments. The outcome of such studies would greatly assist the forestry sector in tropical regions to maintain highly productive and ecologically sound forest plantations in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Plant species effects on microbial communities are attributed to changes in microbial community composition and biomass, and may depend on plant species specific differences in the quality of resources (carbon) inputs. We examined the idea that plant-soil feedbacks can be explained by a chance effect, which is the probability of a highly productive or keystone plant species is present in the community and will influence the functions more than the number of species per se. A13C pulse labelling technique was applied to three plant species and a species mixture in a greenhouse experiment to examine the carbon flow from plants to soil microbial communities. The13C label was given as CO2to shoots of a legume (Lotus corniculatus), a forb (Plantago lanceolata), a grass (Holcus lanatus) and a mixture of the three species. Microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) was analysed in order to determine the biomass and composition of the soil microbial community. The incorporation of the stable isotope into soil microorganisms was determined through GC-IRMS analyses of the microbial PLFAs. Plant species identity did not influence the microbial biomass when determined as total carbon of microbial phospholipid fatty acids. However, the labelled carbon showed that the grass monoculture (H. lanatus) and the plant mixture allocated more13C into bacteria and actinomycete biomass than the other plant species. H. lanatus monocultures had also the highest amounts of13C allocated to AM-fungi and saprophytic fungi. The carbon allocation from plants to soil microorganisms in a plant species mixture can thus be explained by the presence of a highly productive species that influence soil functions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Species' extinctions have spurred debate on whether interactions among few or among many species cause a positive diversity–productivity relationship in experimentally assembled grasslands. We addressed this question by quantifying the productivity of 14 species across an experimental diversity gradient in Minnesota. We found that interspecific interactions leading to coexistence and competitive displacement both determine which species overyield; i.e. are more productive at high diversity. Overyielding species were either superior N competitors (C4 grasses) or N fixers (legumes). Surprisingly, these species were not most productive in monoculture, thus, the ‘selection' of productive species in diverse plots did not cause the positive diversity–productivity relationship. Both positive (with legumes) and negative interspecific interactions (with C4 grasses) determined whether individual species overyielded. Foliar pathogens did not cause overyielding, although other natural enemies may be responsible. Overyielding species are not displacing underyielding species over time, implying that other diversity-promoting interactions also operate in this experiment.},

abstract = {Plant species create aggregations of conspecifics as a consequence of limited seed dispersal, clonal growth and heterogeneous environment. Such intraspecific aggregation increases the importance of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition which may slow down competitive exclusion and promote species coexistence. To examine how spatial aggregation impacts the functioning of experimental assemblages of varying species richness, eight perennial grassland species of different growth form were grown in random and aggregated patterns in monocultures, two-, four-, and eight-species mixtures. In mixtures with an aggregated pattern, monospecific clumps were interspecifically segregated. Mixed model ANOVA was used to test (i) how the total productivity and productivity of individual species is affected by the number of species in a mixture, and (ii) how these relationships are affected by spatial pattern of sown plants. The main patterns of productivity response to species richness conform to other studies: non-transgressive overyielding is omnipresent (the productivity of mixtures is higher than the average of its constituent species so that the net diversity, selection and complementarity effects are positive), whereas transgressive overyielding is found only in a minority of cases (average of log(overyielding) being close to zero or negative). The theoretical prediction that plants in a random pattern should produce more than in an aggregated pattern (the distances to neighbours are smaller and consequently the competition among neighbours stronger) was confirmed in monocultures of all the eight species. The situation is more complicated in mixtures, probably as a consequence of complicated interplay between interspecific and intraspecific competition. The most productive species (Achillea, Holcus, Plantago) were competitively superior and increased their relative productivity with mixture richness. The intraspecific competition of these species is stronger than that of most other species. The aggregated pattern in the full mixture increased the survival of subordinate species, and consequently, we conclude that an aggregated pattern can promote species coexistence (or at least postpone competitive exclusion), particularly in comparison with homogeneously sown mixtures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {1. Traditional tropical agriculture often entails a form of slash-and-burn land management that may adversely affect ecosystem services such as pollination, which are required for suc- cessful crop yields. The Yucat? an Peninsula of Mexico has a >4000 year history of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture, termed ‘milpa'. Hot ‘Habanero' chilli is a major pollinator-depen- dent crop that nowadays is often grown in monoculture within the milpa system. 2. We studied 37 local farmers' chilli fields (sites) to evaluate the effects of landscape compo- sition on bee communities. At 11 of these sites, we undertook experimental pollination treat- ments to quantify the pollination of chilli. We further explored the relationships between landscape composition, bee communities and pollination service provision to chilli. 3. Bee species richness, particularly species of the family Apidae, was positively related to the amount of forest cover. Species diversity decreased with increasing proportion of crop land surrounding each sampling site. Sweat bees of the genus Lasioglossum were the most abun- dant bee taxon in chilli fields and, in contrast to other bee species, increased in abundance with the proportion of fallow land, gardens and pastures which are an integral part of the milpa system. 4. There was an average pollination shortfall of 21% for chilli across all sites; yet the short- fall was unrelated to the proportion of land covered by crops. Rather, chilli pollination was positively related to the abundance of Lasioglossum bees, probably an important pollinator of chilli, as well indirectly to the proportion of fallow land, gardens and pastures that promote Lasioglossum abundance. 5. Synthesis and applications. Current, low-intensity traditional slash-and-burn (milpa) agricul- ture provides Lasioglossum spp. pollinators for successful chilli production; fallow land, gardens and pasture therefore need to be valued as important habitats for these and related ground-nest- ing bee species. However, the negative impact of agriculture on total bee species diversity high- lights how agricultural intensification is likely to reduce pollination services to crops, including chilli. Indeed, natural forest cover is vital in tropical Yucat? an to maintain a rich assemblage of bee species and the provision of pollination services for diverse crops and wild flowers},

abstract = {*\nAfforestation is globally increasing to produce timber and pulp wood, but also to enhance ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, nutrient retention or groundwater recharge. In China, large areas have been and will be afforested in order to compensate for the negative impacts of former clear-cuttings and to make use of the ecosystem services associated with afforestation. In order to further optimize these services with regard to balanced nutrient (particularly nitrogen) cycles, it is important to know whether the use of mixtures of native tree species in afforestation projects promotes the acquisition and retention of nitrogen compared with the currently established large-scale monocultures.\n\n\n\n*\nTo test the effect of species richness on system N retention and tree sapling N uptake, we conducted a 15N tracer experiment in a young tree plantation. To this end, saplings of four abundant early successional tree species were planted in monocultures, in two- and four-species mixtures and as single trees.\n\n\n\n*\nNitrogen retention increased with higher species richness due to enhanced N pools in sapling biomass. These species richness effects strengthened over time.\n\n\n\n*\nSpecies-specific differences in 15N recoveries over time revealed below-ground niche differentiation with regard to N uptake, which is likely to result in complementary resource use among coexisting species.\n\n\n\n*\nSynthesis and applications. This study provides evidence that mixed afforestation promotes N retention from the sapling stage. To further improve ecosystem services associated with afforestation, we strongly suggest the use of mixtures of native tree species instead of monocultures. Mixtures of four species may reduce system N losses and thus may lessen groundwater contamination due to N leaching. We encourage further investigations to find optimal species combinations that promote a wide range of ecosystem services related to more closed nutrient cycles and minimized soil erosion. In our study, the plantations' capability to retain N could be optimized by means of both increasing tree species richness and by choosing the optimal species combinations.},

abstract = {Enhanced species richness can stimulate the productivity of plant communities; however, its effect on the belowground production of forests has scarcely been tested, despite the role of tree roots in carbon storage and ecosystem processes. Therefore, we tested for the effects of tree species richness on mangrove root biomass: thirty-two 6 m by 6 m plots were planted with zero (control), one, two or three species treatments of six-month-old Avicennia marina (A), Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (B) and Ceriops tagal (C). A monoculture of each species and the four possible combinations of the three species were used, with four replicate plots per treatment. Above- and belowground biomass was measured after three and four years' growth. In both years, the all-species mix (ABC) had significant overyielding of roots, suggesting complementarity mediated by differences in rhizosphere use amongst species. In year four, there was higher belowground than aboveground biomass in all but one treatment. Belowground biomass was strongly influenced by the presence of the most vigorously growing species, A. marina. These results demonstrate the potential for complementarity between fast- and slow-growing species to enhance belowground growth in mangrove forests, with implications for forest productivity and the potential for belowground carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Species and functional group (grasses, legumes, creeping nonlegume forbs, rosette nonlegume forbs) richness of species assemblages composed of 16 species from four functional plant groups were manipulated to evaluate the productivity-diversity relationships in a greenhouse pot experiment. Pots were filled with sand, and supplied at two levels of nutrients. The plants were grown in monocultures, two, four, eight and 16 species mixtures. Individual two, four, and eight species mixtures differed in the richness of functional groups. Although the two characteristics of biodiversity, i.e. species and functional group richness, were necessarily correlated, it was shown that it is possible to separate their effect statistically, and also test for their common effect without pronounced loss of test power. There was a pronounced increase of average aboveground biomass and a mild increase in belowground biomass with biodiversity. The effect of functional group richness was more pronounced than the effect of the number of species. By using the method of Loreau and Hector (Nature 411 (2001) 72), selection and complementarity effects were statistically separated, and the overyielding index was calculated as a ratio of the productivity of a mixture to the productivity of its most productive component (to demonstrate transgressive overyielding). Positive values of complementarity and transgressive overyielding were both found, particularly in some rich communities and under high nutrient levels. Complementarity significantly increased only with functional group richness and mainly under high nutrients in the belowground biomass. Some species, when grown in monocultures, had decreased productivity under higher nutrients, and thus were more productive in mixtures than in monocultures. It seems that those species suffered from too high nutrient levels when grown in monocultures, but not in the presence of other species, which were able to use the nutrients in high concentrations and effectively decrease the nutrient levels. As a consequence, mixtures of high diversity were always more productive under high nutrients. The difference in species proportions between high and low nutrients, characterized by chord distance, increased with species richness. The relative change in productivity decreased with the number of functional groups. This suggests that species richness might lead to stabilization of aggregate characteristics (like total productivity) under changing environmental conditions by changing the proportions of individual species. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {Plastic changes in the growth and productivity of algae in response to environment and stocking density are well established. In contrast, the capacity for such changes to persist once environmental differences cease, potentially signalling an evolutionary response, have rarely been tested for algae in intensive production systems. We tested whether continuous differences in harvesting regime (a high stocking density/low-yield regime versus low stocking density/high-yield regime) generated changes in biomass productivity and other growth metrics within several strains of the clonal macroalga Oedogonium (Chlorophyta, Oedogoniales) and whether such changes persisted once differential harvesting yields ceased. We found considerable plasticity in growth rate and biomass productivity over a 12-week period of active selection (i.e. repeated high-yield and low-yield harvesting of clonal lineages within strains) and that strains responded differently to this selection pressure over time. While small, but significant, differences in growth rates of clonal lineages exposed to high-yield vs low-yield harvesting regimes were maintained after prolonged culture under a common selection regime (i.e. medium-yield harvesting), differences in biomass productivity were not. There was no evidence for positive or negative effects of maintaining multiple strains in polyculture on growth and biomass productivity. Overall, we detected limited potential for evolutionary responses to harvesting regime in the main commercial trait of interest—biomass productivity. This outcome is important for commercial cultivation in intensive production systems, since it identifies a low risk that harvesting practices will impact negatively on biomass productivity in the longer term.},

abstract = {1. The importance of peatlands is being increasingly recognized internationally for both the conservation of biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services; strategies are being developed world-wide to help maintain their integrity. Prescribed burning has been highlighted as a threat with considerable debate over its use as it is perceived to produce a Calluna vulgaris monoculture and a decline in preferred peat-forming species. 2. We investigated the impact of prescribed burning on vegetation composition and diversity in a long-term experiment at Moor House NNR in northern England. The study comprised a comparison between no-burn reference plots last burned in ca. 1924 and an experiment where all plots were burned in 1954/5. Within the experiment, the effects of very light sheep grazing vs. no grazing and three burning rotations (no-burn since 1954/5, repeat-burning at 10- and 20-year intervals) were tested. 3. Calluna vulgaris and Hypnum jutlandicum cover and bryophyte species richness increased in the least-disturbed, no-burn reference plots, but bryophyte cover did not. Lichen diversity declined. 4. Within the formal experiment, low-intensity sheep grazing had little impact but there were substantive changes produced by the different burning rotations. There was divergence between the burning rotation treatments with the least-disturbed, no-burn treatment changing towards a C. vulgaris–H. jutlandicum community, whereas the most-disturbed 10-year rotation had a much greater abundance of both Eriophorum and Sphagnum spp. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that blanket-bog vegetation on peat responds to prescribed burning in a complex manner. Where burn return interval is long (>20 years), C. vulgaris becomes dominant and there was no evidence that preferred peat-forming species (Eriophorum/Sphagnum) increased. Where burn return interval is short (10 years), E. vaginatum/ Sphagnum abundance increased. We found no evidence to suggest that prescribed burning was deleterious to the abundance of peat-forming species; indeed, it was found to favour them. These results inform conservation management policy for blanket bogs in the UK and more generally for future wildfire-mitigation strategies on dwarf-shrub-dominated peatlands elsewhere. Some lessons for the management of long-term experimental studies are also discussed.},

abstract = {Belowground interactions in diverse plant communities may be decisive for the performance of individual species and community stability. Here we assessed the effect of tree species richness on belowground fine-root morphology and belowground competition between four different species in a 6-year-old field biodiversity experiment to test the hypotheses: (i) overall fine-root exploitation (total fine-root length and surface area) increases with tree species richness; (ii) belowground interspecific competition is size-symmetric.Overall fine-root length and surface area in the centre of neighbourhoods of four saplings were initially low (1.03kmm-2and 2.00m2m-2), but reached 3.13kmm-2and 6.50 m2m-2, respectively, across all species combinations after two growing seasons in the ingrowth cores. However, no significant differences were found among the different tree species richness levels. The saplings of different tree species grew in proportion to their initial sizes with respect to aboveground basal area increments. For belowground fine-root growth in mixed neighbourhoods, however, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea abies had higher fine-root growth rates in ingrowth cores than in monocultures, whereas the reverse was true for Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea. After two years of root ingrowth, the competitive ability indexes (P. abies=0.07, P. menziesii=0.08, F. sylvatica=-0.19, Q. petraea=-0.18) revealed that belowground competition in this sapling stand was size-asymmetric and that conifers showed a higher competitive ability, when fine-root growth was related to aboveground standing basal area. Nutrient enrichment in ingrowth cores did not affect proliferation rates and morphology of fine roots significantly. Fine-root morphologies of different species were remarkably different, but within each species the morphology was not significantly influenced by tree species richness of neighbourhoods. Our results show that belowground competition may occur earlier than aboveground in mixed forest stands and fine-root growth of dominant species benefitted more from mixing with other species than that of inferior species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1. An important factor limiting the wider application of constructed ecosystems for bioremediation of sites contaminated by toxic chemicals is their relatively low efficiency of contaminant removal. Although there is growing evidence that species-rich ecosystems may out-perform species-poor ecosystems in removing excessive nutrients from water through niche partitioning, it remains unknown whether diverse ecosystems are more efficient in removing toxic chemicals from the environment, and if they are, by what mechanisms diverse ecosystems can lead to enhanced removals. 2. In this study, we exposed aquatic algal microcosm ecosystems of varying species richness to a realistic cadmium (Cd) contamination scenario. We explore the mechanisms of Cd removal by assemblages with differing diversity and consider the potential role of diversity on Cd bioremediation. 3. Our results suggest that Cd removal efficiencies of the algal microcosms increased with species richness. Furthermore, we found that 45% of all polycultures out-performed the monocultures of their most efficient component species in removing Cd from the growth substrates (referred as to 'over Cd removal'). However, the average Cd removal efficiency of the most diverse (eight-species) polycultures was not higher than that of the most efficient monoculture (i.e. the algal species most tolerant to Cd) in this study. We also showed that the observed over Cd removal could be largely ascribed to the enhanced biomass yields of the polycultures, which were mainly driven by the positive effects of Cd-tolerant species on Cd-sensitive species. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that some algal polycultures containing both Cd-tolerant and Cd-sensitive species may show over Cd removal through facilitation provided by Cd-tolerant species. These polycultures are likely to be assembled and applied to achieve Cd removals higher than those of their most efficient component species in monoculture. Given that species-rich ecosystems tend to be more environmentally stable than ones with fewer species, it would be prudent to employ diverse polycultures rather than risk the loss of individual monocultures.},

abstract = {Reforestation and afforestation often takes place in the form of monocultures. These have increasingly come under criticism due to their greater susceptibility to adverse environmental conditions and pathogens and because of the negative long-term impacts they have on soil fertility. Moreover, reservations have frequently been expressed as to whether monoculture is the only way to maximize biomass productivity. Subtropical forests in China are not only rich in tree species but are also diverse in terms of topography. However, historical clear-cutting and the high demand for wood have meant that considerable areas of these forests have been degraded or lost entirely. In recent years, great efforts have been made in subtropical China to restore and afforest vast areas. Nonetheless, conifer monoculture plantations are still prevalent owing to the lack of data on the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and the limited knowledge of the growth performance of native broad-leaved tree species in plantations in this region. In this study, we investigated the growth response of individual tree saplings in a large-scale forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment established in a highly heterogeneous environment in subtropical China (BEF-China). The experiment was established during the period November 2008 to April 2009 and incorporates a species pool of 24 tree species across 261 plots (0.067. ha each) and a broad richness gradient with 1-24 species per plot. Annual growth rates of tree height, stem diameter and crown width for 6723 saplings of 24 species in the third year after establishment were used as response variables. We analyzed the effects of initial size, local abiotic site conditions and local neighborhood on growth performance using mixed effects models. Initial size, local topographic (aspect, slope, curvature, elevation) and edaphic variables (total nitrogen, C/N ratio) as well as local neighborhood variables (competition index, Shannon index) were included as fixed effects. Random effects were plot and species identity. The results showed that growth performance of tree saplings was markedly species-specific and strongly affected by initial size and local site conditions. In this early stage of the experiment, local Shannon diversity did not yet explain a significant amount of variation in sapling growth. However, the significant effect of the increasing size of neighboring trees indicated that tree-tree interactions had already occurred. A greater investment in height growth at the expense of diameter growth suggested that light intercept is the priority for tree sapling growth. This study stresses the importance of better understanding the effects of local site conditions on initial growth in mixed-species plantations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {High species diversity often enhances ecosystem function; however, the effects of diversity have not been commonly explored in the context of natural ecosystem variation. In intermountain grassland, it has been reported that Pinusponderosa canopies and litter reduces the diversity of native species and increases the abundance of Bromus tectorum, an invasive species. Thus this is a realistic system for exploring context-dependency in the effects of diversity on ecosystem function. We established native plant assemblages that varied in species richness and crossed each species richness level with Pinus litter addition. All plots were experimentally invaded with B. tectorum, allowing us to explore context-dependency in the effects of native diversity on community productivity and resistance to exotic invasion. Native polycultures had higher native plant cover, a surrogate for productivity, and stronger resistance to Bromus invasion relative to monocultures. We found that species-independent complementarity effect was the main contributor to the diversity effect on native plant cover, which increased as species richness in polycultures increased. Species-dependent complementarity/selection effects on native cover were negligible, and neither complementarity nor selection effects on native resistance to invasion varied with native richness. Pinus litter had no direct effect on native cover or Bromus performance, but decreased the effects of high native diversity on native cover and increased the effects of high native diversity on native resistance to Bromus. Thus we found some evidence for context-dependency and that low species richness under Pinus canopies might facilitate Bromus invasion. Importantly, the diversity-dependent increase in native plant cover was not correlated with diversity-dependent increases in resistance to invasion among plots, suggesting different mechanisms for how diversity enhances productivity versus resistance.},

abstract = {Contemporary animal–plant interactions such as herbivory are widely understood to be shaped by evolutionary history. Yet questions remain about the role of plant phylogenetic diversity in generating and maintaining herbivore diversity, and whether evolutionary relatedness of producers might predict the composition of consumer communities. We tested for evidence of evolutionary associations among arthropods and the plants on which they were found, using phylogenetic analysis of naturally occurring arthropod assemblages sampled from a plant-diversity manipulation experiment. Considering phylogenetic relationships among more than 900 arthropod consumer taxa and 29 plant species in the experiment, we addressed several interrelated questions. First, our results support the hypothesis that arthropod functional traits such as body size and trophic role are phylogenetically conserved in community ecological samples. Second, herbivores tended to co- occur with closer phylogenetic relatives than would be expected at random, whereas predators and parasitoids did not show phylogenetic association patterns. Consumer specialization, as measured by association through time with monocultures of particular host plant species, showed significant phylogenetic signal, although the strength of this association varied among plant species. Polycultures of phylogenetically dissimilar plant species supported more phylogenetically dissimilar consumer communities than did phylogenetically similar poly- cultures. Finally, we separated the effects of plant species richness and relatedness in predicting the phylogenetic distribution of the arthropod assemblages in this experiment. The phylogenetic diversity of plant communities predicted the phylogenetic diversity of herbivore communities even after accounting for plant species richness. The phylogenetic diversity of secondary consumers differed by guild, with predator phylogenetic diversity responding to herbivore relatedness, while parasitoid phylogenetic diversity was driven by plant relatedness. Evolutionary associations between plants and their consumers are apparent in plots only meters apart in a single field, indicating a strong role for host-plant phylogenetic diversity in sustaining landscape consumer biodiversity.},

abstract = {Studies in experimental grasslands have shown variation in plant individual performance in response to neighbourhood diversity. To which extent these responses are due to phenotypic plasticity or genetic variation is largely unknown. We collected seed families of five herbaceous species (Cirsium oleraceum, Crepis biennis, Plantago lanceolata, Plantago media and Rumex acetosa) in monocultures and 60-species mixtures five years after establishment and replanted or transplanted the offspring into the same monocultures and 60-species mixtures. In all five species the actual environment significantly affected plant survival, growth and performance in terms of shoot biomass and investment into reproduction, indicating stronger competition for light and different levels of herbivory in mixtures as compared with monocultures. Effects of the original environment were smaller and less consistent, but indicated differential selection in monocultures vs. mixtures. The interaction between actual and original environment, corresponding to the " home" vs " away" comparison, was rarely significant, yet this was providing a first sign of local adaptation. We conclude that, for the investigated plant species, more than five growing seasons in monocultures or mixtures would be needed to better demonstrate the selection of genotypes specifically adapted to monocultures or mixtures. A faster local adaptation may have been prevented by the ability of these species to respond to variation in neighbourhood diversity to a large degree via phenotypic plasticity and other factors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.},

abstract = {Casuarina equisetifolia was introduced to China in 1897 from Australia to reduce coastal erosion. It grows vigorously and has spread over much of the southern and southeastern coast, from Zhejiang to Guangxi, over a range of more than 10° of latitude. To date, little is known about its interactions with native species in the coastal zone.We used a field experiment to study how the understorey species diversity and soil conditions in monoculture stands of C. equisetifolia were influenced by different native plant species. We also examined the effects of interplanting native species on plant numbers, leaf area index (LAI), and aboveground biomass accumulation. We planted three native species .Hibiscus tiliaceus, Melia azedarach and Calophyllum inophyllum) at two initial densities in stands of C. equisetifolia.Over a period of ten years, the density and aboveground biomass were relatively low in plots planted with three native species compared to plots that were not planted. In contrast, understory diversity and soil conditions were relatively high where native species were added. Moreover, the number of dead tree, aboveground biomass increment, and diameter growth had significant difference among different native tree species because of their different natural characteristics.The fast-growing pioneer species, M. azedarach, had a positive effect on LAI, regeneration, shrub diversity and grass coverage than the other two native species, and M. azedarach was most effective in plots that were initially planted with higher densities. The pioneer plant H. tiliaceus had more individuals and greater aboveground biomass than others native species. The later-succession species C. inophyllum had the smallest effect on the development of understory vegetation and soil conditions over 10-yrs among three native plants. For different native planted species, M. azedarach showed good effects on the average annual aboveground biomass and DBH increment, and C. inophyllum had the least dead number in coastal environments.In summary, C. equisetifolia and native species have facilitation relationships that differ according to the species, and coastal conservation managers should shift from their traditional focus on C. equisetifolia afforestation to the recognition of multi-species configuration. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Studies manipulating predator diversity and measuring the impact on herbivore abun- dance have found that enhancing predator species richness often increases the strength of prey suppression. This relationship may be due to mechanisms such as complementarity or facilitation, which are considered “true” beneÞts of diversity because greater prey suppression is an emergent property of the multispecies predator community.Oritmaybe due to an identity effect, an “apparent” beneÞt of diversity that results from the greater likelihood of including one particularly voracious predator species as the total number of predator species increases. In separate greenhouse and Þeld experiments, we simultaneously manipulated the species richness and species composition of pred- ators attacking bird cherry-oat aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi) (L.) on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We found that on average aphid suppression by species-rich predator assemblages was greater than suppressionbysingle-species monocultures. However, the performance of individual predator species varied and the species-rich assemblages did not outperform all single-species compositions, suggesting an identity effect. In particular, single-species compositions of the lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) exhibited high performance across experiments, and on average predator assemblages that contained a lady beetle predator had lower overall aphid abundance than compositions where lady beetles were absent. Taken together, these results provide evidence for the dominant role of lady beetles, especially C. maculata, in natural pest suppression and suggest that predator species com- position and identity are important factors to consider in efforts to conserve this valuable ecosystem service.

abstract = {Plant diversity is a key driver of ecosystem functioning best documented for its influence on plant productivity. The strength and direction of plant diversity effects on species interactions across trophic levels are less clear. For example, with respect to the interactions between herbivorous invertebrates and plants, a number of competing hypotheses have been proposed that predict either increasing or decreasing community herbivory with increasing plant species richness. We investigated foliar herbivory rates and consumed leaf biomass along an experimental grassland plant diversity gradient in year eight after establishment. The gradient ranged from one to 60 plant species and manipulated also functional group richness (from one to four functional groups-legumes, grasses, small herbs, and tall herbs) and plant community composition. Measurements in monocultures of each plant species showed that functional groups differed in the quantity and quality of herbivory damage they experienced, with legumes being more damaged than grasses or non-legume herbs. In mixed plant communities, herbivory increased with plant diversity and the presence of two key plant functional groups in mixtures had a positive (legumes) and a negative (grasses) effect on levels of herbivory. Further, plant community biomass had a strong positive impact on consumed leaf biomass, but little effect on herbivory rates. Our results contribute detailed data from a well-established biodiversity experiment to a growing body of evidence suggesting that an increase of herbivory with increasing plant diversity is the rule rather than an exception. Considering documented effects of herbivory on other ecosystem functions and the increase of herbivory with plant diversity, levels of herbivory damage might not only be a result, but also a trigger within the diversity-productivity relationship.},

abstract = {Invertebrate herbivores can impact plant performance and plant communities. Conversely, plants can affect the ability of herbivores to find, choose, and consume them through their functional traits. While single plant traits have been related to rates of herbivory, most often involving single herbivore-plant pairs, much less is known about which suite of plant traits is important for determining herbivory for a pool of plant species interacting with a natural herbivore community. In this study we measured aboveground herbivore damage on 51 herbaceous species growing in monocultures of a grassland biodiversity experiment and collected 42 different plant traits representing four trait groups: physiological, morphological, phenological, and herbivore related. Using the method of random forests and multiple regression, we identified seven traits that are important predictors of herbivore damage (leaf nitrogen and lignin concentration, number of coleopteran and hemipteran herbivores potentially feeding on the plants, leaf life span, stem growth form, and root architecture); leaf nitrogen and lignin concentration were the two most important predictors. The final model accounted for 63% of the variation in herbivore damage. Traits from all four trait groups were selected, showing that a variety of plant characteristics can be statistically important when assessing folivory, including root traits. Our results emphasize that it is necessary to use a multivariate approach for identifying traits affecting complex ecological processes such as herbivory.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits affect the capacity of herbivores to find, choose, and consume plants. However, in a community composed of different plant species, it is unclear what proportion of herbivory on a focal plant is explained by its own traits and which is explained by the characteristics of the surrounding vegetation (i.e., nonadditive effects). Moreover, nonadditive effects could be positive or negative, and it is not known if they are related to community properties such as diversity. To quantify nonadditive effects, we developed four different additive models based on monoculture herbivory rates or plant traits and combined them with measurements of standing invertebrate herbivore damage along an experimental plant diversity gradient ranging from monocultures to 60-species mixtures. In all four models, positive nonadditive effects were detected, i.e., herbivory levels were higher in polycultures than what was expected from monoculture data, and these effects contributed up to 25% of the observed variance in herbivory. Importantly, the nonadditive effects, which were defined as the deviance of the models' predictions from the observed herbivory, were positively correlated with the communities' plant species richness. Consequently, interspecific interactions appear to have an important impact on the levels of herbivory of a community. Identifying those community properties that capture the effects of these interactions is a next important challenge for our understanding of how the environment interacts with plant traits to drive levels of herbivory.},

abstract = {Changes in plant community structure, including the loss of plant diversity may affect soil microbial communities. To test this hypothesis, plant diversity and composition were experimentally varied in grassland plots cultivated with monocultures or mixtures of 2, 3 or 4 species. We tested the effects of monocultures versus mixtures and of plant species composition on culturable soil bacterial activity, number of substrates used and catabolic diversity, microbial biomass N, microbial respiration, and root biomass. These properties were all measured 10 months after seeding the experiment. Soil bacterial activity, number of substrates used and catabolic diversity were measured in the different plant communities using BIOLOG GN and GP microplates, which are redox-based tests measuring capacity of soil culturable bacteria to use a variety of organic substrates. Microbial biomass N, microbial respiration, and root biomass were insensitive to plant diversity. Culturable soil microbial activity, substrates used and diversity declined with declining plant diversity. Their activity, number of substrates used and diversity were significantly higher in plots with 3 and 4 plant species than in monocultures and in plots with 2 species. There was also an effect of plant species composition. Culturable soil microbial activity and diversity was higher in the four-species plant community than in any of the plant monocultures suggesting that the effect of plant diversity could not be explained by the presence of a particular plant species. Our results showed that changes in plant diversity and composition in grassland ecosystems lead to a rapid response of bacterial activity and diversity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Complementary resource use is regarded as a mechanism that contributes to positive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, we used a biodiversity experiment composed of nine potentially dominant species (grasses: Alopecurus pratensis, Arrhenatherum elatius, Dactylis glomerata, Phleum pratense, Poa trivialis; legumes: Trifolium pratense, T. repens; non-legume herbs: Anthriscus sylvestris, Geranium pratense) to test for differences among monocultures and mixtures and for effects of species richness and the presence of particular species on the use of aboveground space. The number of rooting shoots determined in a line transect increased from monocultures to mixtures. Particularly, the presence of A. elatius in mixtures caused a higher shoot density at the community level. The number of pin contacts per sampling point (cumulative cover) at the community level, analysed with the point intercept method, was higher in mixtures than monocultures, and higher in mixtures with than without A. elatius. The effect was attributable to increased densities across the strata of the vertical stand profile as well as to an increase in community height. The impact of species richness on the use of aboveground space differed considerably between individual species. A. elatius achieved increased densities across all strata of the stand profile, while D. glomerata reached higher densities with a more pronounced use of space in the upper strata with increasing species richness of mixtures. Cumulative cover of P. pratense and A. pratensis was not affected by species richness, while the remaining species decreased space use mostly in the upper strata with increasing species richness or in mixtures with the competitively superior A. elatius. Our study shows that potentially dominant species are limited in their ability for adaptive responses to canopy shading. Nevertheless, the differential responses to species richness of individual species with regard to vertical niche occupation resulted in positive diversity effects on aboveground space use at the community level. {\textcopyright} 2008 R{\"{u}}bel Foundation, ETH Z{\"{u}}rich.},

abstract = {Experiments that have manipulated species richness with random draws of species from a larger species pool have usually found that invasibility declines as richness increases. These results have usually been attributed to niche complementarity, and interpreted to mean that communities will become less resistant to invaders as species go locally extinct. However, it is not clear how relevant these studies are to real-world situations where species extinctions are non-random, and where species diversity declines due to increased rarity (i.e. reduced evenness) without having local extinctions. We experimentally varied species richness from 1 to 4, and evenness from 0.44 to 0.97 with two different extinction scenarios in two-year old plantings using seedling transplants in western Iowa. In both scenarios, evenness was varied by changing the level of dominance of the tall grass Andropogon gerardii. In one scenario, which simulated a loss of short species from Andropogon communities, we directly tested for complementarity in light capture due to having species in mixtures with dissimilar heights. We contrasted this scenario with a second set of mixtures that contained all tall species. In both cases, we controlled for factors such as rooting depth and planting density. Mean invader biomass was higher in monocultures (5.4 g m(-2) week(-1)) than in 4-species mixtures (3.2 g m(-2) week(-1)). Reduced evenness did not affect invader biomass in mixtures with dissimilar heights. However, the amount of invader biomass decreased by 60% as evenness increased across mixtures with all tall species. This difference was most pronounced early in the growing season when high evenness plots had greater light capture than low evenness plots. These results suggest that the effect of reduced species diversity on invasibility are 1) not related to complementarity through height dissimilarity, and 2) variable depending on the phenological traits of the species that are becoming rare or going locally extinct.},

abstract = {Studies examining the influence of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning have rarely considered water turnover, the quantitatively most important biogeochemical flux in ecosystems and a process with high sensitivity to climate warming. With a tree sapling experiment consisting of three diversity levels (1, 3, 5 species), 11 different species combinations and two soil moisture levels (moist and dry), we examined the influence of tree species diversity and species identity on stand transpiration (T) under ample and restricted water supply. We further asked whether growth in mixture leads to adaptive responses in the hydraulic system and water loss regulation in plants with heterospecific neighbors compared to plants in monoculture. In moist soil, T was on average ∼11% higher in the mixtures than in the monocultures (significant net diversity effect), which can mostly be attributed to a selection effect. Overyielding in T was highest in mixtures when Tilia cordata and/or Fraxinus excelsior were present. Both species developed larger leaf areas (LA) and sapwood areas (SA) in monocultures than the other species and furthermore increased LA and SA from the monocultures to the mixtures. Thus, inherent species differences in LA and hydraulics, but also neighbor effects on these traits determined T to a large extend. In dry soil, the diversity effect on T was not larger but slightly smaller, which is not in agreement with other published studies. We conclude that differences between pure and mixed sapling assemblages in stand water consumption and drought response are mainly caused by species identity effects, while species diversity seems to be less influential.},

abstract = {Aim Positive relationships between plant species diversity and above-ground productivity have been observed across a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite a critical contribution of below-ground productivity to overall terrestrial productivity, no consensus exists about the nature of the relationship between species diversity and below-ground productivity. Location Global. Methods We collected data from published studies conducted in natural and planted forests and experimental grassland, crop and pot systems that were purposely implemented to isolate the effects of plant species diversity from other factors, such as soil conditions and topographic features. We conducted meta-analyses of 170 observations for root biomass and 23 observations for root production, derived from 48 published studies, using weighted linear modelling with bootstrap procedures to reconcile the effects of diversity on fine root productivity. Results We found that species mixtures had, on average 28.4% higher fine root biomass and 44.8% higher annual production than monocultures. Higher fine root biomass in species mixtures than in monocultures was consistent across natural forests, planted grasslands, croplands and pot systems, except for young planted forests. Transgressive overyielding was only evident for planted grasslands. The log response ratio of fine root biomass in species mixtures to that in respective monocultures increased with species richness across all ecosystem types, and also increased with experiment age in grasslands. Main conclusions Our meta-analysis reveals positive effects of species diversity on below-ground productivity. Despite profound differences in environments among terrestrial ecosystems, our analysis demonstrated that below-ground productivity responds similarly to variations in species richness. Furthermore, our study also reveals shifts in the effects of diversity over time in both forests and grasslands. Future efforts are needed to further understand below-ground productivity–diversity relationships.},

abstract = {Climate change has an impact on all levels of biodiversity: genes, species, populations and ecosystems. This effect is expected to be dependent on the rate of change. When faced with unfavorable environmental conditions, individuals have three non-exclusive options by which they can mitigate these changes: temporal alterations in phenology, spatial tracking of optimal conditions or in situ adaptation. For the latter to occur requires the existence of variability among conspecifics with respect to traits that directly or indirectly influence individual performance and fitness. One such "functional" trait is thermal stress tolerance. We investigated the presence of intraspecific functional trait variability of isofemale lineages of the free-living marine nematode Litoditis marina in monoculture, double and quadruple mixtures under thermal stress, which was applied in a gradient and a sudden treatment over 20. days, corresponding to at least four generations. We found a high degree of intraspecific functional trait variability relevant to thermal tolerance. This type of variability has traditionally been considered negligible compared to interspecific variation, but our results demonstrate the importance of its inclusion within trait-based eco-evolutionary studies as this will confer increased accuracy when inputting physiological parameters to relevant models (e.g. species distribution models). Additionally, we found a significant effect of the temperature treatments. In accordance with the majority of experimental evidence, our populations showed a stronger response to a sudden versus a gradient increase in temperature. Contrary to our expectations, no significant differences were observed between monocultures, double and quadruple lineage mixtures suggesting that increased intraspecific trait variability did not lead to higher fitness in L. marina populations exposed to thermal stress.},

abstract = {While it is well-established that the spatial distribution of soil nutrients (soil heterogeneity) influences the competitive ability and survival of individual plants, as well as the productivity of plant communities, there is a paucity of data on how soil heterogeneity and global change drivers interact to affect plant performance and ecosystem functioning. To evaluate the effects of elevated CO(2), soil heterogeneity and diversity (species richness and composition) on productivity, patterns of biomass allocation and root foraging precision, we conducted an experiment with grassland assemblages formed by monocultures, two- and three-species mixtures of Lolium perenne, Plantago lanceolata and Holcus lanatus. The experiment lasted for 90 days, and was conducted on microcosms built out of PVC pipe (length 38 cm, internal diameter 10 cm). When nutrients were heterogeneously supplied (in discrete patches), assemblages exhibited precise root foraging patterns, and had higher total, above- and belowground biomass. Greater aboveground biomass was observed under elevated CO(2). Species composition affected the below:aboveground biomass ratio and interacted with nutrient heterogeneity to determine belowground and total biomass. Species richness had no significant effects, and did not interact with either CO(2) or nutrient heterogeneity. Under elevated CO(2) conditions, the two- and three-species mixtures showed a clear trend towards underyielding. Our results show that differences among composition levels were dependent on soil heterogeneity, highlighting its potential role in modulating diversity-productivity relationships.},

abstract = {G. emini, a mechanistic model linking plant functional traits, plant populations, community dynamics, and ecosystem scale fluxes in grasslands has been reported in a companion paper (Soussana et al., 2012). For monocultures and six species mixtures of perennial grass species, this model has been successfully evaluated against experimental data of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and plant community structure across nitrogen and disturbance (cutting frequency) gradients. The G. emini model combines two categories of processes: (i) C and N fluxes, (ii) morphogenesis and architecture of roots and shoots and demography of clonal plant axes. These two process categories constrain the form and function of the simulated clonal plants within plastic limits. We show here that the plasticity of the simulated plant populations accounts for well-established empirical laws: (i) root:shoot ratio, (ii) self-thinning, (iii) critical shoot N content, and (iv) role of plant traits (specific leaf area and plant height) for population response to environmental gradients (nitrogen and disturbance). Moreover, we show that model versions for which plasticity simulation has been partly or fully suppressed have a reduced ANPP in monocultures and in binary mixtures and do not capture anymore productivity and dominance changes across environmental gradients. We conclude that, along environmental and competition gradients, the plasticity of plant form and function is required to maintain the coordination of multiple resource capture and, hence, to sustain productivity and dominance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are key organisms in the N cycle, as they control the first, rate-limiting step of the nitrification process. The question whether current environmental disturbances, such as climate warming and plant diversity losses, select for a particular community structure of AOB and/or influence their activity remains open. The purpose of this research was to study the impact of a 3 °C warming and of plant species richness (S) on microbial activity and diversity in synthesized grasslands, with emphasis on the nitrification process and on the diversity (community structure and richness) of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). We measured soil chemical characteristics, basal respiration, potential nitrification and AOB diversity in soils under increasing plant species richness (S = 1, S = 3, S = 9) at ambient and (ambient +3 °C) temperature. Species were drawn from a 9-species pool, belonging to three functional groups: forbs, legumes and grasses. Mixtures comprised species from each of the three functional groups. Warming did not affect AOB diversity and increased potential nitrification at S = 3 only. Under warmed conditions, higher plant species richness resulted in increased potential nitrification rates. AOB richness increased with plant species richness. AOB community structure of monocultures under legumes differed from those under forbs and grasses. Clustering analysis revealed that AOB community structure under legume monocultures and mixtures of three and nine species grouped together. These results indicate that functional group identity rather than plant species richness influenced AOB community structure, especially through the presence of legumes. No clear relationship emerged between AOB richness and potential nitrification whatever plant species richness and temperature treatment. Our findings show a link between aboveground and belowground diversity, namely plant species richness, AOB richness and community structure. AOB richness was not related to soil processes, supporting the idea that increased diversity does not necessarily lead to increased rates of ecosystem processes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The relationship between species richness and productivity is important from both a basic, theoretical perspective and also because it has important ramifications for applied ecology including ecosystem restoration and the design of carbon offset plantings. While a more species-rich community is often believed to be more productive than a species-poor community, findings from observational and experimental studies differ and our understanding of the relationship comes largely from grasslands. Consequently, we aimed to determine for the first time the nature of the species richness-productivity relationship in a southern-hemisphere dry sclerophyll ecosystem. We investigated the impact of species richness on productivity, plant density and mean plant biomass at three sowing densities in three species assemblages. Eucalyptus globulus, Acacia mearnsii and Allocasuarina verticillata were each grown as monocultures and included in every subsequent level of species richness, forming three distinct species assemblages. Communities were grown in a glasshouse pot experiment for four months, then harvested and above-ground biomass measured. We found no general species richness-productivity relationship in the communities studied. There were no overall increases in productivity as species richness increased and in fact in most cases the productivity of communities with 4 and 8 species was lower than monocultures of the dominants. Importantly, density influenced the way richness affected productivity and this effect was dependent upon assemblage, indicating that species identity is a key determinant of productivity. These results demonstrate important ecological principles in a previously untested system. A key outcome of this experiment is that density alters the relationship between species richness and initial productivity in assemblages of Australian dry sclerophyll species. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Proposed perennial bioenergy cropping systems include both native grass monocultures and polycultures of grasses and forbs. We determined the effect of species richness and composition on establishment and initial biomass production of native plant polycultures. Twelve treatments with varying levels of species richness (1-24 species) were established. Establishment success and yield varied over eight locations. The number of species established in polyculture increased linearly as the number of species seeded increased. Average biomass yield ranged from 1.2 to 6.0 Mg ha(-1) with the highest yielding treatments being grass monocultures or an eight species grass legume mixture. An increase in species richness from one to eight species increased yield an average of 28%, but increasing species richness from 8 to 12 or 24 species had no yield advantage at most locations. Early successional species, Canada milkvetch (Astragalus canadensis L.) and Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximilian Schrad.), were dominant in mixtures and contributed a majority of the biomass to the yield. Even in high diversity plots, biomass was from only a few plant species with a single species dominating the mixture. Our results suggest that selected low diversity mixtures (one to five species) likely offer the best combination of species establishment and high yield during stand establishment. However, we expect that early successional species that were dominant during the establishment phase of our experiment will contribute less biomass as stands mature and later successional species will become dominant and provide greater biomass.},

The framework for future expansion of ethanol production, to meet with supply needs at national and international levels using the current production model, does not take into consideration the prospect of Brazil's regional and rural development. Although currently there are no impediments to the culture of sugar cane in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State, Brazil's largest producer of biodiesel, it imports 98% of its demand for ethanol from S{\~{a}}o Paulo and other regions. The promotion of ethanol market in that State might pass for a productive model different from the practice in industrial monocultures, given their cultural and agricultural characteristics.

abstract = {Numerous studies have reported positive effects of species richness on plant community productivity. Such biodiversity effects are usually quantified by comparing the performance of plant mixtures with reference monocultures. However, several mechanisms, such as the lack of resource complementarity and facilitation or the accumulation of detrimental agents, suggest that monocultures are more likely than mixtures to deteriorate over time. Increasing biodiversity effects over time could therefore result from declining monocultures instead of reflecting increases in the functioning of mixtures. Commonly, the latter is assumed when positive trends in biodiversity effects occur. Here, we analysed the performance of 60 grassland species growing in monocultures and mixtures over 9 years in a biodiversity experiment to clarify whether their temporal biomass dynamics differed and whether a potential decline of monocultures contributed significantly to the positive net biodiversity effect observed. Surprisingly, individual species' populations produced, on average, significantly more biomass per unit area when growing in monoculture than when growing in mixture. Over time, productivity of species decreased at a rate that was, on average, slightly more negative in monocultures than in mixtures. The mean net biodiversity effect across all mixtures was continuously positive and ranged between 64-217 g per m(2). Short-term increases in the mean net biodiversity effect were only partly due to deteriorating monocultures and were strongly affected by particular species gaining dominance in mixtures in the respective years. We conclude that our species performed, on average, comparably in monocultures and mixtures; monoculture populations being slightly more productive than mixture populations but this trend decreased over time. This suggested that negative feedbacks had not yet affected monocultures strongly but could potentially become more evident in the future. Positive biodiversity effects on aboveground productivity were heavily driven by a small, but changing, set of species that behaved differently from the average species.},

abstract = {1. Positive effects of biodiversity on plant productivity may result from diversity-induced changes in the size or density of individual plants, yet these two possibilities have never been tested at the same time in a biodiversity experiment with a large species pool. Here, we distinguish between size effects and density effects on plant productivity, using data from 198 experimental grassland communities that contained 1–16 species. Plant modules such as tillers or rosettes were defined as relevant units, being equivalent to plant individuals in the majority of species. 2. In agreement with previous studies, we found positive effects of species richness on above-ground productivity. We show that this positive biodiversity effect resulted from diversity-induced increases in module density rather than from increases in module size. In contrast, variation in productivity within diversity levels was related to module size rather than module density. 3. The size–density relationships varied among plant functional groups and among species but their average response to increasing species richness paralleled the pattern observed at the level of the entire plant communities: species richness had a positive effect on above-ground species biomass and species module density but not on species module size. Twenty-four out of 26 overyielding species had denser populations and 25 out of 28 underyielding species had smaller modules in mixtures than in monocultures. 4. Synthesis . In grasslands, an increase in community productivity must involve an increase in plant size or density. We found that diversity-induced increases in productivity were related to diversity- induced increases in density, whereas diversity-independent increases in productivity were related to increases in plant size. Our results suggest that increased density of overyielding species in mixtures was the main driver of the positive biodiversity–productivity relationship in our experiment. We conclude that the mechanisms leading to enhanced productivity of species-rich as compared with species-poor communities cannot be derived from mechanisms explaining high productivity within communities that contain a particular number of species.},

The objective of this study was to determine the benefits of intercropping in terms of energetic, economic and land-sparing potential through the framework of the stress-gradient hypothesis. We expected more intercropping benefits under stressful abiotic conditions. From 126 studies that were retrieved from the scientific literature, 939 intercropping observations were considered. When compared to the same area of land that was managed in monoculture, intercrops produced 38% more gross energy (mean relative land output of 1.38) and 33% more gross incomes (mean relative land output of 1.33) on average, whilst using 23% less land (mean land equivalent ratio of 1.30). Irrigation and the aridity index in non-irrigated intercrops did not affect land equivalent ratio, thereby indicating that intercropping remains beneficial, both under stressful and non-stressful contexts concerning moisture availability. Fertilisation and intercropping patterns (rows and strips vs. mixed) did not affect land equivalent ratio. Although intercropping offers a great opportunity for intensification of existing agricultural lands, many challenges need to be tackled by experts from multiple disciplines to ensure its feasible implementation.},

abstract = {In 1955, an experiment was established at Gisburn forest in northern England to compare the performance of pure and mixed plots of four species: Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and common alder (Alnus glutinosa). At the end of the first rotation, there was enhanced growth in all mixtures with Scots pine while there was a negative interaction in the Norway spruce/sessile oak mixture. The experiment was felled in 1989 after windblow and replanted in 1991, when Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) was added to the species trialled. After 20 years of the second rotation, patterns of individual species growth were generally similar to those in the first rotation, except that height and diameter growth of Norway spruce and Scots pine was significantly greater (P < 0.01) in mixed plots. Basal area growth of three combinations (Sitka spruce/Scots pine; Norway spruce/Scots pine; Norway spruce/common alder) was about 40 per cent greater than (and significantly different from) that predicted from performance in pure plots of the same species, evidence of transgressive overyielding. These results indicate that facilitation effects through improved nutrient status can lead to better productivity in mixed-species stands in planted forests. The implications of these findings for policies seeking to diversify single species planted forests are considered.},

abstract = {Aim of the study: An experiment was established in 1966 to compare the growth and development of 50: 50 mixtures of Sitka spruce ( Picea sitchensis ) with either Japanese larch ( Larix kaempferi ) or tamarack ( L. laricina ) with that found in pure plots of Sitka spruce. The site was one of moderate nitrogen availability where the presence of heather ( Calluna vulgaris ) could be expected to limit the growth ofSitka spruce. Area of the study: North-east Scotland. Material and methods : There were different patterns of spruce growth in the pure plots and in the mixtures, with faster spruce growth in mixture in the years approaching and immediately following canopy closure (i.e. ages 15-25). Foliage analysis suggested that this was linked with improved nitrogen status of spruce trees in the mixed compared to the pure plots. Main results : At years 20 and 25 there were significant differences in height, diameter, and basal area between treatments, with the largest basal area being found in the Japanese larch/Sitka spruce mixtures, indicative of overyielding in the mixed plots. However, when the experiment was clearfelled at 41 years of age, all treatments had self-thinned to produce spruce dominated stands of similar height with only an occasional larch tree surviving in plots that were originally 50:50 mixtures. Research highlights : There were no differences between treatments in basal area, harvested volume or sawlog outturn after 41 years. These results can be interpreted as showing facilitation between the larch and the spruce during the establishment phase followed by competition for light once canopy closure had occurred. Keywords : Mixed stand dynamics; facilitation; nitrogen status; product outturn.},

abstract = {Planting multiple species in wetland restoration sites could potentially accelerate ecological succession while enhancing ecological services. Our study of thick-mat floating marsh demonstrated that two species performed better than monocultures for developing a more structurally sound root mat. Although Panicum hemitomon is the typical dominant and focal species of all restoration efforts of this habitat type, we evaluated the effects of additional species, including Sagittaria lancifolia, a ubiquitous floating marsh constituent, and three laterally growing specialists (Alternanthera philoxeroides, Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, and Ludwigia peploides). In a mesocosm experiment, we found greater P. hemitomon biomass in monocultures but greater vegetative cover and total mat biomass with P. hemitomon plus L. peploides, but not greater biomass in the most species-rich treatment or treatment with the greatest initial planting density. We conclude that L. peploides aids restoration of thick-mat floating marsh by increasing mat buoyancy, enhancing lateral growth, and providing greater root mat structural integrity. This type of laterally growing specialist should accelerate coalescence of neighboring constructed and naturally formed mats. Planting species that occupy complementary niches should also minimize competition for key resources.},

abstract = {Plant performance is determined by the balance of intra- and interspecific neighbors within an individual's zone of influence. If individuals interact over smaller scales than the scales at which communities are measured, then altering neighborhood interactions may fundamentally affect community responses. These interactions can be altered by changing the number (species richness), abundances (species evenness), and positions (species pattern) of the resident plant species, and we aimed to test whether aggregating species at planting would alter effects of species richness and evenness on biomass production at a common scale of observation in grasslands. We varied plant species richness (2, 4, or 8 species and monocultures), evenness (0.64, 0.8, or 1.0), and pattern (planted randomly or aggregated in groups of four individuals) within 1 9 1 m plots established with transplants from a pool of 16 tallgrass prairie species and assessed plot-scale biomass production and diversity over the first three growing seasons. As expected, more species-rich plots produced more bio- mass by the end of the third growing season, an effect associated with a shift from selection to complementarity effects over time. Aggregating conspecifics at a 0.25-m scale marginally reduced biomass production across all treatments and increased diversity in the most even plots, but did not alter biodiversity effects or richness–productivity relationships. Results support the hypothesis that fine- scale species aggregation affects diversity by promoting species coexistence in this system. However, results indicate that inherent changes in species neighbor- hood relationships along grassland diversity gradients may only minimally affect community (meter) – scale responses among similarly designed biodiversity– ecosystem function studies. Given that species varied in their responses to local aggregation, it may be possible to use such species-specific results to spatially design larger-scale grassland communities to achieve desired diversity and pro- ductivity responses.},

abstract = {In soft-bottom sediments, consumers may influence ecosystem function more via engineering that alters abiotic resources than through trophic influences. Understanding the influence of bioturbation on physical, chemical, and biological processes of the water-sediment interface requires investigating top-down (consumer) and bottom-up (resource) forces. The objective of the present study was to determine how consumer bioturbation mode and sediment properties interact to dictate the hydrologie function of experimental filtration systems clogged by the deposition of fine sediments. Three fine-grained sediments characterized by different organic matter (OM) and pollu- tant content were used to assess the influence of resource type: sediment of urban origin highly loaded with OM and pollutants, river sediments rich in OM, and river sediments poor in OM content. The effects of consumer bioturbation (chironomid larvae vs. tubificid worms) on sediment reworking, changes in hydraulic head and hydraulic conductivity, and water fluxes through the water-sediment interface were measured. Invertebrate influences in reducing the clogging process depended not only on the mode of bioturbation (construction of biogenic structures, burrowing and feeding activities, etc.) but also on the interaction between the bioturbation process and the sediments of the clogging layer. We present a conceptual model that highlights the importance of sediment influences on bioturbation and argues for the integration of bottom-up influence on consumer engineering activities.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Proliferation of macroalgal blooms is regulated by grazing pressure and nutrient availability, which may be mediated directly by benthic macroinvertebrates or indirectly through feedback mechanisms. Using invertebrates common to a shallow estuary in Cape Cod, Massachusetts (USA), we determined effects of faunal diversity on benthic microalgae, net ecosystem metabolism, sediment nutrient fluxes, and macroalgal biomass and productivity. Laboratory microcosms contained sediments with single- and mixed-species invertebrate assemblages, in the presence of (1) no macroalgae, (2) a macroalgal monoculture, and (3) a realistic macroalgal polyculture. The deposit-feeding gastropod Ilyanassa obsoleta suppressed benthic microalgae, enhanced nitrate efflux from sediments, and maintained macroalgal standing stocks. Conversely, the burrowing, omnivorous polychaete Alitta (formerly Nereis) virens stimulated benthic microalgal growth, inhibited efflux of ammonium, and drastically reduced macroalgal biomass via grazing and translocation of thalli below the sediment surface. In the polyculture experiment, A. virens sequentially removed Gracilaria sp. (Rhodophyta), Ulva sp. (Chlorophyta), and finally Fucus vesiculosus (Phaeophyta). The bivalve Mya arenaria exhibited limited effects on benthic dynamics. In mixed-fauna assemblages, biomass and productivity of benthic microalgae and macroalgae were consistently lower than predicted, revealing non-additive effects of biodiversity. Communities dominated by I. obsoleta or other surficial grazers could indirectly promote macroalgal blooms via sustained release of sediment-derived nutrients and reduction of benthic microalgae. In contrast, omnivorous burrowers such as A. virens may buffer symptoms of eutrophication through inhibition of ammonium supply and direct grazing of bloom-forming macroalgae. Overall, our results highlight species-specific effects on key ecosystem functions, and demonstrate important feedbacks between top-down and bottom-up controls in shallow estuaries.},

Compared to the nutrient-addition treatment, species richness and diversity were strongly reduced upon nutrient depletion. The functional group of bacterial feeders particularly suffered severely from nutrient depletion. The decrease in diversity of bacterial feeders was linked to reduced species richness and diversity of large omnivorous species, as predicted by trophic-dynamic models. Tilman's (1976) statement, that under low nutrient levels the best competitor dominates the system, was applicable in our system. Upon nutrient depletion, resource depletion led to a monoculture of 1 small bacterial feeder, but even after 2 years of resource depletion, up to 16 species still coexisted. Our results provide strong evidence that freshwater nematode systems can be regulated by nutrient competition.},

abstract = {Models predict that vertical gradients of foliar nitrogen (N) allocation, increasing from bottom to top of plant canopies, emerge as a plastic response to optimise N utilisation for carbon assimilation. While this mechanism has been well documented in monocultures, its relevance for mixed stands of varying species richness remains poorly understood. We used 21 naturally assembled grassland communities to analyse the gradients of N in the canopy using N allocation coefficients (K N ) estimated from the distribution of N per foliar surface area (KN-F) and ground surface area (KN-G). We tested whether: 1) increasing plant species richness leads to more pronounced N gradients as indicated by higher K N -values, 2) K N is a good predictor of instantaneous net ecosystem CO2 exchange and 3) functional diversity of leaf N concentration as estimated by Rao's Q quadratic diversity metric is a good proxy of K N . Our results show a negative (for KN-G) or no relationship (for KN-F) between species richness and canopy N distribution, but emphasize a link (positive relationship) between more foliar N per ground surface area in the upper layers of the canopy (i.e. under higher KN-G) and ecosystem CO2 uptake. Rao's Q was not a good proxy for either K N .},

abstract = {The role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. Two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. In Exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (Streptococcus bovis strain 26, Prevotella ruminicola strain 23, Eubacterium ruminantium B1C23, Ruminococcus albus SY3, Fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. S85, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94) were used in vitro to determine the effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, VFA, and ruminal H2 and CH4 in mono or coculture with Methanobrevibacter smithii. The specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees C in Hungate tubes under a CO2 gas phase. A monoculture of M. smithii was grown similarly, except under H2:CO2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. In Exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. In Exp. 1, cultures of R. albus (P < 0.01) and R. flavefaciens (P < 0.05) produced the most H2 among strains and resulted in greater (P < 0.01) CH4 production when cocultured with M. smithii than other coculture combinations. Cultures of S. bovis and E. ruminantium + M. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. In Exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (P < 0.01). Biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (P < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (P < 0.05) in the ruminal fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. The molecular analysis of the 16S rDNA showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. Bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.},

abstract = {In an experiment that directly manipulated grassland plant species richness and composition, decreased plant species richness ("diversity") increased pathogen load (the percentage of leaf area infected by species-specific foliar pathogens across the plant community) in 1998. Pathogen load was almost three times greater in the average monoculture than in the average plot planted with 24 grassland plant species, an approximately natural diversity. Eleven individual diseases increased in severity (percentage of leaf area infected by a single disease) at lower plant species richness, and severity of only one disease was positively correlated with diversity. For 10 of the 11 diseases whose severity was negatively related to diversity, disease severity was positively correlated with host abundance, and in six of these cases, species diversity had no effect on disease severity after controlling for the effects of host abundance. These results suggest that increased abundances of individual host species at lower species diversity increased disease transmission and severity. In 1996 and 1997, similar results for a smaller number of diseases sampled were found in this experiment and another similar one. Although the effect of diversity on disease was highly significant, considerable variance in pathogen load remained among plots of a given diversity level. Much of this residual variance was explained by community characteristics that were a function of the species composition of the communities (the identity of species present vs. those lost). Specifically, communities that lost less disease-prone species had higher pathogen loads; this effect explained more variance in pathogen load than did diversity. Also, communities that lost the species dominant at high diversity had higher pathogen loads, presumably because relaxed competition allowed greater increases in host abundances, but this effect was weak. Among plant species, disease proneness appeared to be determined more by regional than local processes, because it was better correlated with frequency of the plant species' populations across the region than with local abundance or frequency across the state. In total, our results support the hypothesis that decreased species diversity will increase foliar pathogen load if this increases host abundance and, therefore, disease transmission. Additionally, changes in community characteristics determined by species composition will strongly influence pathogen load.},

Eight years after tree seedlings were planted in a field experiment, we revisited the site and tested how tree species composition affects the dynamics of N mineralization and nitrification. Both tree species composition and season significantly influenced the soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON). N-fixing Acacia crassicarpa monoculture had the highest DON, and 10-mixed species plantation had the highest DOC. The lowest DOC and DON concentrations were both observed in Eucalyptus urophylla monoculture. The tree species composition also significantly affected net N mineralization rates. The highest rate of net N mineralization was found in A. crassicarpa monoculture, which was over twice than that in Castanopsis hystrix monoculture. The annual net N mineralization rates of 10-mixed and 30-mixed plantations were similar as that of N-fixing monoculture. Since mixed plantations have good performance in increasing soil DOC, DON, N mineralization and plant biodiversity, we recommend that mixed species plantations should be used as a sustainable approach for the restoration of degraded land in southern China.},

abstract = {1. Advances in root ecology have revealed that root standing biomass is higher in species-rich plant communities than in species-poor communities. Currently, we do not know whether this below-ground diversity effect is the result of enhanced root production or reduced root mortal- ity or both, which is essential information to understand ecosystem functioning, as it deter- mines C sequestration and N dynamics in soil. 2. Minirhizotron observations were combined with root coring in five different plant commu- nities (four monocultures and the respective mixture). Molecular markers were used to quanti- tatively determine species abundance in mixed root biomass samples in order to track shifts in below-ground species composition. In addition, a litterbag experiment was performed to study root decomposition independent of root mortality. 3. Root length production was greater and root length loss was lower in the mixture than expected from monocultures in all years. Simulations suggest that at least two species must have had reduced losses in mixture compared to monoculture. However, the diversity effects on root mortality may partially be explained by selection effects as the species with the longest root life span became dominant in the mixtures. Root length loss from minirhizotrons was very low; the combination of minirhizotron length measurements with root biomass estimates from coring suggested underestimation of root loss in minirhizotrons over time. Root decomposition was not affected by diversity. 4. Diversity enhanced root length production and decreased root loss, resulting in below- ground overyielding. With decomposition unaffected, our results suggest that root mortality is reduced with increasing diversity. Future studies have to reveal the generality of our observa- tions in larger scale biodiversity experiments by using species having a wider variety of root traits.},

abstract = {P>1. Plant diversity has profound effects on primary production. Plant diversity has been shown to correlate with increased primary production in nutrient-limited grassland ecosystems. This overyielding has been attributed to vertical niche differentiation among species below-ground, allowing for complementarity in resource capture. However, a rigorous test of this longstanding hypothesis is lacking because roots of different species could not be distinguished in diverse communities. 2. Here, we present the first application of a DNA-based technique that quantifies species abundances in multispecies root samples. We were thus able to compare root distributions in monocultures of two grasses and two forbs with root distributions in four-species mixtures. In order to investigate if vertical niche differentiation is driven by soil nutrient depletion, the topsoil layer of the communities were either nutrient-rich or -poor. 3. Immediately in the first year, 40% more root biomass was produced in mixtures than expected from the monocultures, together with significant below-ground complementarity effects, probably preceding above-ground overyielding. This below-ground overyielding appeared not to be the result of vertical niche differentiation, as rooting depth of the community tended to decrease, rather than increase in mixtures compared to monocultures. Roots thus tended to clump in the very dense topsoil layer rather than segregate over the whole profile in mixtures. The below-ground overyielding was mainly driven by enhanced root investments of one species, Anthoxanthum odoratum, in the densely rooted topsoil layer without retarding the growth of the other species. 4. Synthesis. Conventional ecological mechanisms, such as competition for nutrients, do not seem to be able to explain the increased root investments of A. odoratum in mixtures compared to monocultures, with apparently little effect on the root growth of the other species. Instead, the observed root responses are consistent with species-specific root recognition responses. From a community perspective, the observed early below-ground overyielding may initiate the recently reported increased soil organic matter, mineralization and N availability and thus may ultimately be responsible for the higher productivity at high plant species diversity.},

abstract = {Although much is known about drivers of productivity in Douglas-fir and red alder stands, less is known about how productivity may relate to stand transpiration and water use efficiency. We took advantage of a 15-year-old experiment involving Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and red alder (Alnus rubra) in the western Cascade Range of western Oregon to test the following hypotheses: (a) more productive stands transpire more water, (b) the relationship between productivity and transpiration differs between species, and (c) the relationship between productivity and transpiration differs between sites varying in soil moisture and fertility. Furthermore, the experimental design included alder, a facultative nitrogen-fixing species, which could also affect fertility. Fixed area plots (20×20m) were planted as monocultures of each species or in mixtures at a common density (1100treesha-1) in a randomized-block design. Transpiration of Douglas-fir and red alder was measured using heat dissipation sensors installed in eight trees per plot and scaled to the plot level based on sapwood basal area for each species. Although up to 53% of the variability in tree transpiration was explained by basal area, irrespective of species or site conditions, the two stands with the highest biomass and sapwood basal area did not transpire the most. Instead of more productive stands transpiring more water, the greatest variability in both productivity and transpiration was determined by site conditions and to a lesser degree, species composition. For example, 70% of the variation in tree biomass increment (TBI) was determined by leaf area index, which was much higher at the site with higher fertility and soil moisture (p<0.05). Despite marked phenological and physiological differences, Douglas-fir and red alder performed similarly. Only 19% of annual water use of Douglas-fir occurred between October and March when alder was leafless. Also, there was no evidence of a fertilization effect of the nitrogen-fixing red alder on the Douglas-fir: the nitrogen concentration and N-isotopic ratio of Douglas-fir needles did not differ whether trees were grown in monoculture or in mixtures with red alder. We conclude that lower soil fertility and contrasting microclimate at one site relative to the other suppressed NPP while maintaining higher transpiration, thus reducing water use efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We tested the hypotheses that predation intensity is negatively related to plant species richness, and that prey density is positively related to plant species richness. We performed one field and one mesocosm experiment based on a benthic estuarine food web to measure the effects of macroalgal species richness on the predation of a herbivorous amphipod by a carnivorous fish. In the mesocosm experiment, prey mortality was significantly lower in the 5 species algal polyculture than in the average monoculture, suggesting that increasing algal richness decreased predation intensity. In the field experiment, prey colonization and density were positively related to algal richness in the presence of a diverse guild of predators. Combined, these results suggest that primary producer richness can influence animal community structure and food web dynamics, emphasizing the need for biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research in realistic, multitrophic systems.},

abstract = {While the ecological consequences of plant diversity have received much attention, the mechanisms by which intraspecific diversity affects associa-ted communities remains understudied. We report on a field experiment documenting the effects of patch diversity in the plant Baccharis salicifolia (genotypic monocultures versus polycultures of four genotypes), ants (pres-ence versus absence) and their interaction on ant-tended aphids, ants and parasitic wasps, and the mechanistic pathways by which diversity influences their multi-trophic interactions. Five months after planting, polycultures (versus monocultures) had increased abundances of aphids (threefold), ants (3.2-fold) and parasitoids (1.7-fold) owing to non-additive effects of genetic diversity. The effect on aphids was direct, as plant genetic diversity did not mediate ant–aphid, parasitoid–aphid or ant–parasitoid interactions. This increase in aphid abundance occurred even though plant growth (and thus aphid resources) was not higher in polycultures. The increase in ants and para-sitoids was an indirect effect, due entirely to higher aphid abundance. Ants reduced parasitoid abundance by 60 per cent, but did not affect aphid abun-dance or plant growth, and these top-down effects were equivalent between monocultures and polycultures. In summary, intraspecific plant diversity did not increase primary productivity, but nevertheless had strong effects across multiple trophic levels, and effects on both herbivore mutualists and enemies could be predicted entirely as an extension of plant–herbivore interactions.},

abstract = {The cosmopolitan common reed (Phragmites australis) has been expanding into previously unoccupied wetland habitats throughout North America. This invasion by a non-native haplotype of Phragmites has become a major concern due to a reduction in plant diversity, reduction of faunal biodiversity, and changes in ecosystem structure. A randomized complete block design was used to compare the efficacy of two herbicides, glyphosate (Rodeo, Dow AgroSciences, IN, U.S.A.) and imazapyr (Habitat, BASF Corporation, NC, U.S.A.), on 1-ha Phragmites monoculture in a shallow borrow pit. Six foliar experimental treatments were applied consisting of (1) 2% glyphosate formulation, June application; (2) 2% glyphosate formulation, September application; (3) 2% imazapyr formulation, June application; (4) 2% imazapyr formulation, September application; (5) 5% imazapyr formulation, June application; and (6) 5% imazapyr, September application. Experimental plots were monitored yearly for two years after treatment. Relative importance values (RIV) were determined to assess the efficacy of herbicide treatments. We report that imazapyr foliar application is statistically superior to glyphosate in reducing Phragmites RIV, with no significant differences between the 2 and 5% formulations. Both herbicides are more effective in reducing Phragmites RIV if applied early in the growing season (June). No significant differences in non-Phragmites plant recolonization were observed between herbicide treatments over the two-year time course. These results suggest that imazapyr is superior in reducing Phragmites RIV, and that earlier applications of herbicides may be more effective on Phragmites. However, managers must note that adjacent nontarget plant species may be negatively affected by earlier treatments.},

abstract = {The effects of global environmental changes on soil nitrogen (N) pools and fluxes have consequences for ecosystem functions such as plant productivity and N retention. In a 13-year grassland experiment, we evaluated how elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ), N fertilization, and plant species richness alter soil N cycling. We focused on soil inorganic N pools, including ammonium and nitrate, and two N fluxes, net N mineralization and net nitrification. In contrast with existing hypotheses, such as progressive N limitation, and with observations from other, often shorter, studies, elevated CO2 had relatively static and small, or insignificant, effects on soil inorganic N pools and fluxes. Nitrogen fertilization had inconsistent effects on soil N transformations, but increased soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Plant species richness had increasingly positive effects on soil N transformations over time, likely because in diverse subplots the concentrations of N in roots increased over time. Species richness also had increasingly positive effects on concentrations of ammonium in soil, perhaps because more carbon accumulated in soils of diverse subplots, providing exchange sites for ammonium. By contrast, subplots planted with 16 species had lower soil nitrate concentrations than less diverse subplots, especially when fertilized, probably due to greater N uptake capacity of subplots with 16 species. Monocultures of different plant functional types had distinct effects on N transformations and nitrate concentrations, such that not all monocultures differed from diverse subplots in the same manner. The first few years of data would not have adequately forecast the effects of N fertilization and diversity on soil N cycling in later years; therefore, the dearth of long-term manipulations of plant species richness and N inputs is a hindrance to forecasting the state of the soil N cycle and ecosystem functions in extant plant communities.},

abstract = {The relationship between plant diversity and productivity in grasslands could depend, partly, on how diversity affects vertical distributions of root biomass in soil; yet, no prior study has evaluated the links among diversity, root depth distributions, and productivity in a long-term experiment. We used data from a 12-year experiment to ask how plant species richness and composition influenced both observed and expected root depth distributions of plant communities. Expected root depth distributions were based on the abundance of species in each community and two traits of species that were measured in monocultures: root depth distributions and root-to-shoot ratios. The observed proportion of deep-root biomass increased more than expected with species richness and was positively correlated with aboveground productivity. Indeed, the proportion of deep-root biomass explained variation in productivity even after accounting for legume presence/abundance and greater nitrogen availability in diverse plots. Diverse plots had root depth distributions that were twice as deep as expected from their species composition and corresponding monoculture traits, partly due to interactions between C4 grasses and legumes. These results suggest that the productivity of diverse plant communities was partly dependent on belowground plant interactions that caused roots to be distributed more deeply in soil.},

While this\npattern of associational resistance is frequently reported, experimental\nevidence for underlying mechanisms is rare particularly for potential\nplant species diversity effects on focal host plants and their physical\nenvironment. Here, we used an established forest diversity experiment to\ndetermine whether tree diversity effects on an important insect pest are\ndriven by concomitant changes in host tree growth or the light\nenvironment. We examined the effects of tree species richness, canopy\ncover and tree growth on the probability of occurrence, the abundance,\nand volume of galls caused by the pineapple gall adelgid Adelges abietis\non Norway spruce. Although tree diversity had no effect on gall\nabundance, we observed that both the probability of gall presence and\ngall volume (an indicator of maternal fecundity) decreased with tree\nspecies richness and canopy cover around host spruce trees. Structural\nequation models revealed that effects of tree species richness on gall\npresence and volume were mediated by concurrent increases in canopy\ncover rather than changes in tree growth or host tree density. As canopy\ncover did not influence tree or shoot growth, patterns of associational\nresistance appear to be driven by improved host tree quality or more\nfavourable microclimatic conditions in monocultures compared to\nmixed-stands. Our study therefore demonstrates that changes in forest\nstructure may be critical to understanding the responses of herbivores\nto plant diversity and may underpin associational effects in forest\necosystems.},

abstract = {Producer diversity is known to affect a wide range of ecosystem processes including plant growth and insect pest resistance. Consumers such as mammalian herbivores too have been shown to modify plant growth and insect herbivory by triggering changes in host plants. However, few studies have investigated whether consumer effects interact with plant species diversity effects on a focal plant. To unravel consumer-diversity interactions, we recorded both the presence and intensity of winter browsing by moose (Alces alces) on silver birch (Betula pendula) in a long-term forest diversity experiment in Finland and measured birch tree growth as well as insect chewing damage during the following growing season. Although browsing on birch by moose was not affected by tree species richness, the intensity of moose damage altered tree diversity effects on birch tree growth. At minor browsing intensity, tree height, trunk diameter and canopy projections showed positively humped relationships with tree diversity, peaking at 3-species mixtures. Growth of moderately browsed trees increased with tree species richness, but growth of severely browsed birch trees was unaffected. Moose browsing also altered the direction of tree diversity effects on insect herbivory on birch. Unbrowsed trees experienced lower insect chewing damage in mixed stands (associational resistance) whilst browsed trees suffered more insect chewing damage in diverse stands (associational susceptibility). Increasing browsing intensity also reversed the relationship between tree species richness and insect chewing damage from negative to positive. The observed interactions between moose browsing and tree species richness effects could be explained by lower canopy cover of more diverse stands compared with birch monocultures, leading to increased re-growth capacity and more high-quality foliage of browsed birch trees in more open diverse stands. Our findings demonstrate that both the presence and intensity of mammalian browsing may modify the magnitude and even the direction of tree diversity effects on tree growth and susceptibility to insect herbivory. Differences in consumer impact among studies may thus potentially explain much of the observed variability in plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning and must therefore be taken into account in future studies.},

We found no relationship between species richness and biomass under constant conditions. However, when communities were exposed to experimental drought, biomass increased with species richness. Responses of individual species demonstrated that facilitative interactions rather than sampling effects or niche complementarity best explained results-survivorship increased for almost all species, and those species least resistant to drought in monoculture had the greatest increase in biomass. Positive interactions may be an important but previously underemphasized mechanism linking high diversity to high productivity under stressful environmental conditions.},

abstract = {1. The interaction between mutualism, facilitation or interference and exploitation competition is of major interest as it may govern species coexistence. However, the interplay of these mechanisms has received little attention. This issue dates back to Gause, who experimentally explored competition using protists as a model [Gause, G.F. (1935) V{\'{e}}rifications exp{\'{e}}rimentales de la th{\'{e}}orie math{\'{e}}matique de la lutte pour la vie. Actualit{\'{e}}s Scientifiques et Industrielles, 277]. He showed the coexistence of Paramecium caudatum with a potentially allelopathic species, Paramecium bursaria. 2. Paramecium bursaria hosts the green algae Chlorella vulgaris. Therefore, P. bursaria may benefit from carbohydrates synthesised by the algae. Studying endosymbiosis with P. bursaria is possible as it can be freed of its endosymbiont. In addition, C. vulgaris is known to produce allelochemicals, and P. bursaria may benefit also from allelopathic compounds. 3. We designed an experiment to separate the effects of resource exploitation, endosymbiosis and allelopathy and to assess their relative importance for the coexistence of P. bursaria with a competitor that exploits the same resource, bacteria. The experiment was repeated with two competitors, Colpidium striatum or Tetrahymena pyriformis. 4. Results show that the presence of the endosymbiont enables the coexistence of competitors, while its loss leads to competitive exclusion. These results are in agreement with predictions based on resource equilibrium density of monocultures (R*) supporting the idea that P. bursaria's endosymbiont is a resource provider for its host. When P. bursaria and T. pyriformis coexist, the density of the latter shows large variation that match the effects of culture medium of P. bursaria. Our experiment suggests these effects are because of biochemicals produced in P. bursaria culture. 5. Our results expose the hidden diversity of mechanisms that underlie competitive interactions. They thus support Gauses's speculation (1935) that allelopathic effects might have been involved in his competition experiments. We discuss how a species engaged both in competition for a resource and in costly interference such as allelopathy may counterbalance these costs with a resource-provider endosymbiont.},

abstract = {In plant communities, invasion resistance may increase with diversity because empty niche space decreases simultaneously. However, it is not clear if this only applies to exotic species or also to native species arriving at a site with few other native species during community assembly. We tested the latter by transplanting four native species into experimental grassland communities varying in species richness form 1-16 (-60) species. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that invasion is less successful if the invading species belongs to a functional group that is already present in the community. The test invaders included a grass species (Festuca pratensis, FP), a short (Plantago lanceolata, PL) and a tall herb species (Knautia arvensis, KA), and a legume species (Trifolium pratense, TP). The same four functional groups also occurred alone or in all possible combinations in the different experimental communities. The overall performance of the transplants was negatively related to the logarithm of the species richness of host communities. Plant biomass declined by 58%, 90%, 84% and 62% in FP, PL, KA and TP, respectively, from monocultures to 16-species mixtures, indicating lower invasiveness of the two herbs than of the grass and the legume. Resident grasses showed a strong negative effect on the performance of all test invaders, whereas resident small and tall herbs had neutral, and resident legumes had positive effects. The case of the legumes indicates that contributions to invasion resistance need not parallel invasiveness. Communities containing resident species of only one functional group were most inhibitive to transplants of the same functional group. These results indicate that invasion resistance of experimental plant communities is related to the degree of niche overlap between resident species and invaders. This niche overlap can be high due to generally low amounts of empty niche space in species-rich resident communities or due to the occurrence of the same functional group as the one of the invader in the resident community. Stronger within-than between-functional-group invasion resistance may be the key mechanism underlying diversity effects on invasion resistance in grassland and other ecosystems at large.},

In 2009, we established 48 research plots on three soil types\nat an Iowa site with a uniform history of row crop production. We seeded\neach plot with one of four treatments of native prairie vegetation: (1)\nswitchgrass monoculture, (2) warm-season grass mix (5 grass species),\n(3) biomass mix (16 species of grasses, legumes, and forbs), or (4)\nprairie mix (32 species of grasses, legumes, forbs, and sedges). In\n2010, we measured vegetation characteristics and studied butterfly use\nof the plots to investigate the hypothesis that more diverse plant\ncommunities would support a greater abundance and diversity of\nbutterflies. Habitat characteristics varied significantly among the\nplots by treatment and soil type, and butterflies responded rapidly to\nvariation in floral abundance and richness. Averaged over the entire\ngrowing season, butterflies were six times more abundant and twice as\nspecies rich in the biomass and prairie mix plots compared to the\nwarm-season grass and switchgrass plots. Our results suggest that\nimplementation of biomass production using diverse mixes of native\nprairie vegetation on marginal lands could have positive effects on the\nmaintenance of butterfly populations in agricultural landscapes.},

abstract = {* The maintenance of habitat heterogeneity in agricultural landscapes has been promoted as a key strategy to conserve biodiversity. Animal response to grassland heterogeneity resulting from spatiotemporal variation in disturbance is well documented; however, the degree to which edaphic variation generates heterogeneity detectable by grassland wildlife has proven more difficult to study in natural settings. * We conducted a field experiment to study how soils directly affect vegetation structure and composition and indirectly affect bird and butterfly assemblages using plantings of tallgrass prairie species managed as agroenergy crops in Iowa, USA. The experimental design included four vegetation treatments of varying species richness replicated on three soil types. * Habitat characteristics varied widely among soils. Crops on sandy loam, the driest, most acidic soil with the lowest nutrient content, developed shorter, less dense vegetation with sparse litter accumulation and more bare ground compared to crops on loam and clay loam. * Birds and butterflies responded similarly to soil-induced variation in habitat characteristics. Their abundance and species richness were similar on all soils, but their assemblage compositions varied among soils in certain vegetation treatments. * In low-diversity grass crops, bird assemblages using sandy loam were dominated by species preferring open ground and sparse vegetation for foraging and nesting, whereas assemblages using loam and clay loam were dominated by birds preferring tall, dense vegetation with abundant litter. In high-diversity prairie crops, the species composition of forbs in bloom varied among soils and strongly influenced butterfly assemblages. * Synthesis and applications. Prairie agroenergy crops established with identical management practices developed variable habitat characteristics due to natural edaphic variation, and this heterogeneity influenced the spatial distribution of bird and butterfly assemblages due to differential habitat use among species. This finding suggests that if unfertilized prairie crops were grown for agroenergy by land managers large-scale, soil-induced habitat heterogeneity would promote wildlife diversity within and among fields, further increasing the habitat value of these crops compared to the fertilized, annual monocultures that currently dominate the agricultural landscape. Our study also highlights the need for managers to consider soil properties when selecting sites to restore grassland habitat for species of conservation concern.},

abstract = {The harsh and stressful growing environment of extensive green roofs means that only a limited range of plant species is routinely used. However, ecological theory suggests that highly diverse or species-rich vegetation might be more resistant and resilient to severe environmental stress. This paper describes an experiment investigating the influence of vegetation diversity on green roof plant survival following an imposed drought. Twelve species were selected from the three major taxonomic and functional plant groups that are commonly used for extensive green roofs (forbs, sedums and grasses). Four species were chosen from each group and planted in combinations of increasing diversity and complexity: monocultures, four-species mixtures and twelve-species mixtures. Three watering regimes were imposed: wet, moderate and dry (watering every 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks, respectively). It was concluded that a diverse plant mix was more advantageous than a monoculture in terms of greater survivability and higher visual rating under dry conditions. It was shown that combinations of species differing in functional diversity and complexity achieved this more effectively compared to plants of the same taxonomic group that compete for resources when grown together. Drought tolerance in sedums was superior to that in forbs and grasses. Little difference in drought tolerance was observed between forbs and grasses, which must be watered before reaching a permanent wilting point. Plants that exhibited over 50% leaf desiccation were unable to survive to the end of the study. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Algae-derived biocrude oil is a possible renewable energy alternative to fossil fuel based crude oil. Outdoor cultivation in raceway ponds is estimated to provide a better return on energy invested than closed photobioreactor systems. However, in these open systems, algal crops are subjected to environmental variation in temperature and irradiance, as well as biotic invasions which can cause costly crop instabilities. In this paper, we used an experimental approach to investigate the ability of species richness to maximize and stabilize biocrude production in the face of weekly temperature fluctuations between 17 and 27 degrees C, relative to a constant-temperature control. We hypothesized that species richness would lead to higher mean biocrude production and greater stability of biocrude production over time in the variable temperature environment. Counter to our hypothesis, species richness tended to cause a decline in mean biocrude production, regardless of environmental temperature variation. However, biodiversity did have stabilizing effects on biocrude production over time in the variable temperature environment and not in the constant temperature environment. Altogether, our results suggest that when the most productive and stable monoculture is unknown, inoculating raceway ponds with a diverse mixture of algae will tend to ensure stable harvests over time.},

abstract = {European forests host a diversity of tree species that are increasingly threatened by fungal pathogens, which may have cascading consequences for forest ecosystems and their functioning. Previous experimental studies suggest that foliar and root pathogen abundance and disease severity decrease with increasing tree species diversity, but evidences from natural forests are rare. Here, we tested whether foliar fungal disease incidence was negatively affected by tree species diversity in different forest types across Europe. We measured the foliar fungal disease incidence on 16 different tree species in 209 plots in six European countries, representing a forest-type gradient from the Mediterranean to boreal forests. Forest plots of single species (monoculture plots) and those with different combinations of two to five tree species (mixed species plots) were compared. Specifically, we analyzed the influence of tree species richness, functional type (conifer vs. broadleaved) and phylogenetic diversity on overall fungal disease incidence. The effect of tree species richness on disease incidence varied with latitude and functional type. Disease incidence tended to increase with tree diversity, in particular in northern latitudes. Disease incidence decreased with tree species richness in conifers, but not in broadleaved trees. However, for specific damage symptoms, no tree species richness effects were observed. Although the patterns were weak, susceptibility of forests to disease appears to depend on the forest site and tree type.},

abstract = {Most experimental biodiversity–ecosystem functioning research to date has addressed herbaceous plant communities. Comparably little is known about how forest com- munities will respond to species losses, despite their importance for global biogeochemical cycling. We studied tree species interactions in experimental subtropical tree communities with 33 distinct tree species mixtures and one, two, or four species. Plots were either exposed to natural light levels or shaded. Trees grew rapidly and were intensely competing above ground after 1.5 growing seasons when plots were thinned and the vertical distribution of leaves and wood determined by separating the biomass of harvested trees into 50 cm height increments. Our aim was to analyze effects of species richness in relation to the vertical allocation of leaf biomass and wood, with an emphasis on bipartite competitive interactions among species. Aboveground productivity increased with species richness. The community- level vertical leaf and wood distribution depended on the species composition of communities. Mean height and breadth of species- level vertical leaf and wood distributions did not change with species rich- ness. However, the extra biomass produced by mixtures compared to monocultures of the component species increased when vertical leaf distributions of monocultures were more differ- ent. Decomposition of biodiversity effects with the additive partitioning scheme indicated pos- itive complementarity effects that were higher in light than in shade. Selection effects did not deviate from zero, irrespective of light levels. Vertical leaf distributions shifted apart in mixed stands as consequence of competition- driven phenotypic plasticity, promoting realized com- plementarity. Structural equation models showed that this effect was larger for species that differed more in growth strategies that were characterized by functional traits. In 13 of the 18 investigated two- species mixtures, both species benefitted relative to intraspecific competition in monoculture. In the remaining five pairwise mixtures, the relative yield gain of one species exceeded the relative yield loss of the other species, resulting in a relative yield total (RYT) exceeding 1. Overall, our analysis indicates that richness–productivity relationships are pro- moted by interspecific niche complementarity at early stages of stand development, and that this effect is enhanced by architectural plasticity.},

abstract = {Experiments addressing the role of plant species diversity for ecosystem\nfunctioning have recently proliferated. Most studies have focused\non plant biomass responses. However, microbial processes involved\nin the production of N2O and the oxidation of atmospheric CH4 could\npotentially be affected via effects on N cycling, on soil diffusive\nproperties (due to changes in water relations and root architecture)\nand by more direct interactions of plants with soil microbes. We\nstudied ecosystem-level CH4 and N2O fluxes in experimental communities\nassembled from two pasture soils and from combinations of 1, 3, 6,\n8 or 9 species typical for these pastures. The soils contrasted with\nrespect to texture and fertility. N2O emissions decreased with diversity\nand increased in the presence of legumes. Soils were sinks for CH4\nat all times; legume monocultures were a smaller sink for atmospheric\nCH4 than non-legume monocultures, but no effect of species richness\nper se was detected. However, both the exchange of CH4 and N2O strongly\ndepended on plant community composition, and on the interaction of\ncomposition with soil type, indicating that the functional role of\nspecies and their interactions differed between soils. N2O fluxes\nwere mainly driven by effects on soil nitrate and on nitrification\nwhile soil moisture had less of an effect. Soil microbial C and N\nand N mineralisation rates were not altered. The driver of the interactive\nsoil typexplant community composition-effects was less clear. Because\nsoil methanotrophs may take longer to respond to alterations of N\ncycling than the 1/2 year treatment in this study, we also tested\nspecies richness-effects in two separate 5-year field studies, but\nresults were ambiguous, indicating complex interactions with soil\ndisturbance. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that plant community\ncomposition can affect the soil trace gas balance, whereas plant\nspecies richness per se was less important; it also indicates a potential\nlink between the botanical composition of plant communities and global\nwarming.},

abstract = {AimsInvasion resistance in experimental plant communities is known to increase with increasing diversity and further to depend on the presence of particular functional groups. To test whether these effects also hold true for the invader establishment phase beyond the seedling stage, we studied survival and performance of Centaurea jacea L. (brown knapweed) planted into experimental grassland communities of varying plant biodiversity over three consecutive years. Moreover, we analysed the role of insect herbivory and biomass of the recipient community for mediating diversity effects. MethodsIn 2005, seedlings of Centaurea were transplanted into experimental grassland communities (the Jena Experiment) covering a species richness (1-60) and functional group richness (1-4) gradient. Half of these transplants and the community surrounding them in each plot were sprayed with insecticide while the other half served as control. In 2006 and 2007 (during the second and third year after transplantation), we recorded survival, growth-related (e.g. transplant biomass, height) and reproduction-related traits (e.g. number of flower heads). Annual data on community aboveground biomass served as covariate to investigate mediating effects of aboveground competition with the recipient community. Important FindingsSpecies richness was the most important factor responsible for Centaurea limitation. Higher levels of diversity decreased survival and all performance traits in both years. These diversity effects were partly driven by community biomass, but not fully explained by that covariate, suggesting the importance also of further processes. The influence of functional group richness was strong in the second year after transplantation and weaker in the third year. Among the particular functional groups, only the presence of legumes showed strong negative effects on Centaurea survival and weak negative effects on growth and reproduction, the latter two being mediated by biomass. Insect herbivore reduction considerably benefited Centaurea in sprayed monocultures, where it grew significantly larger than in all other diversity levels and than in the control subplots. We conclude that effects of plant community properties on invading individuals change in the course of establishment, that plant species richness effects are also important during later stages of establishment, and that biomass (especially at high diversity) and herbivory (especially at low diversity) of the recipient community are important in mediating community effects on invaders.},

We used an experimental warming treatment to examine the potential influence of global warming on plant growth and interspecific interactions in a temperate steppe in northern China. Materials and methodsSix dominant plant species were grown in monoculture and all 15 two-species mixtures for one growing season under ambient and elevated temperatures in the field. Temperature was manipulated with infrared radiators. Important findingsTotal biomass of all the six plant species was increased by 34-63% in monocultures and 20-76% in mixtures. The magnitude of the warming effect on biomass was modified by plant interactions. Experimental warming changed the hierarchies of both competitive response and competitive effect. The competitive ability (in terms of response and effect) of one C4 grass (Pennisetum centrasiaticum) was suppressed, while the competitive abilities of one C3 forb (Artemisia capillaris) and one C3 grass (Stipa krylovii) were enhanced by experimental warming. The demonstrated alterations in growth and plant interactions may lead to changes in community structure and biodiversity in the temperate steppe in a warmer world in the future.},

abstract = {Summary 1. There is a clear need to improve our ability to assess the ecological consequences of environmental change. Because of the complexity of ecosystems and a need to disentangle the effects of multiple pressures, predictions are often reliant on models and expert opinion. These require validation with observed data; in this respect, long-term datasets are particularly valuable. 2. Innovative statistical methods (nonparametric regression and additive models) are presented for identifying nonparametric ecological trends and changes in seasonality in response to environmental change. These are illustrated through the example of Loch Leven, a shallow freshwater lake. 35 years of monitoring data are examined spanning periods of enrichment, ecological recovery and changing climate. 3. Models are developed for phosphorus and nitrogen; temperature and rainfall; Daphnia grazers; and chlorophylla with the ecological objectives to examine trends in water quality and the corresponding trends in nutrient availability, grazer abundance and climate. 4. The analysis highlighted a generally decreasing availability of phosphorus over the study period and generally increasing nonparametric trends in nitrate concentrations and rainfall. Increasing spring temperatures were also evident as were significant nonparametric changes in summer grazer densities. 5. Significant reductions in spring and summer chlorophylla are highlighted, related to the return of Daphnia to the loch. However, no response in chorophylla is apparent to the later declining trends in phosphorus, but seasonality has changed. 6. Synthesis and applications. The analysis highlights the value of nonparametric statistical models for assessing complex ecological responses to environmental change. The models outlined can examine key ecological impacts of climate change, particularly effects on the timing of seasonal events and processes. The models are illustrated using long-term water quality data from Loch Leven to explore patterns in key environmental drivers and ecological responses affecting freshwater ecosystems. Analysis of chlorophylla in particular, highlighted the value of examining the seasonal trends separately, with different trends evident for winter and spring and a changing seasonal pattern.},

abstract = {Concerted use of legumes and of functional diversity in grassland forage systems can provide major contributions to the challenges of agricultural systems being productive yet environmental friendly. Acquisition and transformation of nitrogen (N) resources by legumes and grasses were studied in a temperate grassland experiment near Zurich (Switzerland) to investigate mechanisms driving effects of functional diversity in mixed swards and to optimise mixtures for efficient resource use.Grass-legume interactions and N availability were varied by manipulating legume percentage of the sward (0-100%) and N fertiliser application (50, 150 or 450kgofNha-1year-1).15N technology quantified N derived from symbiotic (Nsym) and non-symbiotic (Nnonsym) sources.Generally, acquisition of Nsym by the entire mixture was stimulated by grasses. As a result, strong overyielding of Nsym occurred (e.g. 75 and 114% for year 1 and 2 at N150) and mixtures with only 60% and 37% legumes (year 1 and 2) already attained the same Nsym yield as pure legume stands. Legumes stimulated Nnonsym acquisition by the entire mixture, largely via increased uptake by the grass component. Thus, overyielding of Nnonsym of 31% occurred in year 1 (N150).Mutual grass-legume interactions stimulated acquisition of Nsym, acquisition of Nnonsym and efficient transformation of N into biomass compared to either monocultures. These effects of functional diversity can substantially contribute to productive and resource efficient agricultural grassland systems and were maximised in mixtures with 40-60% legumes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Our objective was to assess the nutrient economy of five native tree species and their response to different neighbor trees in an experimental plantation in Panama. In our study, H. crepitans was the least nutrient efficient tree species. H. crepitans produced less biomass in mixtures than in monocultures while Cedrela odorata - the most nutrient efficient species - produced more biomass independent of stem growth rates because they acquired more nutrients in mixtures than in monocultures.Three-species mixtures had increased mean Ca concentrations in branches and stems and increased N, P, K, Ca, and Mg storage in aboveground biomass compared to monocultures suggesting complementary resource uptake. Our results highlight the need to properly consider species-specific nutrient requirements and species interactions when designing tree mixtures for afforestation.},

abstract = {1.Belowground resource partitioning is often proposed as the underlying mechanism for the positive relationship between plant species richness and productivity. For example, if species have different root distributions, a mixture of plant species may be able to use the available resources more completely than the individual species in a monoculture. However, there is little experimental evidence for differentiation in vertical root distributions among species and its contribution to biodiversity effects. 2.We determined species-specific root standing biomass over depth using molecular techniques (real time-qPCR) in a large grassland biodiversity experiment (1-8 plant species mixtures), in two years. Species-specific root biomass data were used to disentangle the effects of positive interactions between species (complementarity effects) and effects due to dominance of productive species (selection effects) on root biomass in mixtures. In a next step, these biodiversity effects were linked to the diversity of rooting depths and the averaged rooting depth of the community. 3.Root biomass increased with species richness. This was mainly due to positive interactions (the complementarity effect), which increased with species richness belowground. In contrast, the selection effect decreased with species richness. Although there was considerable variation in vertical root distribution between species in monocultures, the diversity of rooting strategies did not explain the complementarity effect. Rather, the abundance of deep-rooting species in mixtures (i.e. high community weighted mean) was significantly related to the complementarity effect. Comparing the ‘predicted' root distribution (based on monocultures) to the actual distribution in mixtures, we found that mixtures rooted deeper than expected, but this did not better explain the complementarity effect. 4.Synthesis: This study demonstrates that vertical root distributions of species provide only subtle evidence for resource partitioning. We found no evidence that functional diversity in vertical rooting patterns was important for the complementarity effect, in contrast to our expectation that the enhancement of productivity was due to resource partitioning. Alternatively, we found significant but weak relationships between the complementarity effect and deep-rooting communities, based on the community weighted mean root distribution. This suggests that factors other than belowground resource partitioning alone may drive the biodiversity-productivity relationship. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bioturbation processes of a dense ophiuroid assemblage were studied by in situ time-lapse sediment-profile imagery (t-SPI) and laboratory tracer-experiments. The burrows of 4 Amphiura fliformis (Ophiuroida) individuals were visible throughout the t-SPI deployment. Mean burrow excavation was 2.9 cm(2) h(-1). Mounding ranged from 0 to 7.12 m(2) h(-1). Loss of sediment from the sediment-water interface ranged from 0 to 7.0 cm(2) h(-1). Bioturbation at the station was dominated by A. filiformis, whose presence appeared to mask the activity of conspecifics. Species interactions were investigated in terms of particle reworking by laboratory luminophore-tracer experiments of monocultures and species mixtures using A. filiformis, Leptopentacta elongata (Holothuroida) and Nephtys hombergii (Polychaeta). Bioturbation by these large species fit a symmetric non-local model well. Species interactions led to underyielding with respect to predicted additive species-effects. Treatments containing A. filiformis were significantly different from treatments without A. filiformis, and not significantly different from each other. When the data was processed on a per capita basis, multiculture treatments containing N. hombergii underyielded due to the high biomass of N. hombergii and its relatively low bioturbation activity. Ordination of a distance matrix derived from tracer profiles showed that tracer profiles produced by multispecies treatments were most similar to the strongest bioturbator, due to destruction of conspecific structures by the strongest bioturbator. Species interactions are not additive in terms of particle bioturbation, and may be difficult to predict without knowing in situ densities.},

abstract = {We hypothesised that plant species composition and richness would affect soil chemical and microbial community properties, and that these in turn would affect soil microbial resistance and resilience to an experimentally imposed drying disturbance. We performed a container experiment that manipulated the composition and species richness of common pasture plant species (Trifolium repens, Lolium perenne, and Plantago lanceolata) by growing them in monoculture, and in all the possible two and three-way combinations, along with an unplanted control soil. Experimental units were harvested at four different times over a 16-month period to determine the effect of plant community development and seasonal changes in temperature and moisture on belowground properties. Results showed that plant species composition influenced soil chemistry, soil microbial community properties and soil microbial resistance and resilience. Soil from planted treatments generally showed reduced soil microbial resistance to drying compared to unplanted control soils. Soils from under T. repens showed a higher resistance and resilience than the soils from under P. lanceolata, and a higher resistance than soils from under L. perenne. We suggest that differences across soils in either resource limitation or soil microbial community structure may be responsible for these results. Plant species richness rarely affected soil microbial community properties or soil microbial resistance and resilience, despite having some significant effects on plant community biomass and soil nitrogen contents in some harvests. The effect that treatments had for most variables differed between harvests, suggesting that results can be altered by the stage of plant community development or by extrinsic environmental factors that varied with harvest timing. These results in combination show that soil microbial resistance and resilience was affected by plant community composition, and the time of measurement, but was largely unrelated to plant species richness.},

abstract = {We measured aboveground plant biomass and soil inorganic nitrogen pools in a biodiversity experiment in northern Sweden, with plant species richness ranging from 1 to 12 species. In general, biomass increased and nitrate pools decreased with increasing species richness. Transgressive overyielding of mixed plant communities compared to the most productive of the corresponding monocultures occurred in communities with and without legumes. N-2-fixing legumes had a fertilizing function, while non-legumes had a N retaining function. Plant communities with only legumes had a positive correlation between biomass and soil nitrate content, whereas in plant communities without legumes they were negatively correlated. Both nitrate and ammonium soil pools in mixed non-legume communities were approximately equal to the lowest observed in the corresponding monocultures. In mixed legume/non-legume communities, no correlation was found for soil nitrate with either biomass or legume biomass as percentage of total biomass. The idea of complementarity among species in nitrogen acquisition was supported in both pure non-legume and mixed non-legume/legume communities. In the latter, however, facilitation through increased nitrogen availability and retention, was probably dominating. Our results suggest that diversity effects on biomass and soil N pools through resource use complementarity depend on the functional traits of species, especially N-2 fixation or high productivity.},

abstract = {Plant diversity can affect ecological processes such as competition and herbivory, and these ecological processes can act as drivers of evolutionary change. However, surprisingly little is known about how ecological variation in plant diversity can alter selective regimes on members of the community. Here, we examine how plant diversity at two different scales (genotypic and species diversity) impacts natural selection on a focal plant species, the common evening primrose (Oenothera biennis). Because competition is frequently relaxed in both genotypically and species rich plant communities, we hypothesized that increasing diversity would weaken selection on competitive ability. Changes in plant diversity can also affect associated arthropod communities. Therefore, we hypothesized that diversity would alter selection on plant traits mediating these interactions, such as herbivory related traits. We grew 24 focal O. biennis genotypes within four different neighbourhoods: genotypic monocultures or polycultures of O. biennis, and species monocultures or polycultures of old-field species that commonly co-occur with O. biennis. We then measured genotypic selection on nine plant traits known to be ecologically important for competition and herbivory. Focal O. biennis plants were smaller, flowered for shorter periods of time, had lower fitness, and experienced greater attack from specialist predispersal seed predators when grown with conspecifics versus heterospecifics. While neither conspecific nor heterospecific diversity altered trait means, both types of diversity altered the strength of selection on focal O. biennis plants. Specifically, selection on plant biomass was stronger in conspecific monocultures versus polycultures, but weaker in heterospecific monocultures versus polycultures. We found no evidence of selection on plant traits that mediate insect interactions, despite differences in arthropod communities on plants surrounded by conspecifics versus heterospecifics. Our data demonstrate that plant genotypic and species diversity can act as agents of natural selection, potentially driving evolutionary changes in plant communities.},

Moreover, positive effects of genotypic diversity were enhanced by the presence of deer, indicating a non-additive interaction between diversity and trophic-level complexity.

abstract = {Over the last 20 years, a change in traditional land use practices has taken place in central Germany. Formerly species-rich dry grassland communities have been converted into communities with greatly reduced diversity in many places. Whereas grass species have expanded, several forbs have declined in abundance. For the present study, plant-plant interactions were assessed between the expanding grass Festuca rupicola and the forb Dianthus carthusianorum - two typical, companion grassland species - to ascertain any associated effects of land use change. A competition experiment was set up with replacement design, in which pots were placed in the open field and monitored over two consecutive years. In order to assess the performance of both species in monoculture (D9, F9) and mixture (D3F6, D6F3) the parameters biomass, length of flowering stems, number of flowering stems and number of flowers per individual, or length of panicles, were analyzed. Positive and negative interactions were evaluated using the "Relative Neighbour Effect" index (RNE). To simulate land use by grazing or mowing, individuals in half of the pots were clipped in the first year after sowing. At this time, performance of D. carthusianorum - in terms of length of flowering stems, number of flowering stems and number of flowers - was significantly affected: whereas the first parameter increased, both of the other parameters decreased with increasing presence of the grass species. However, RNE indicated facilitation with a low number of F. rupicola individuals, and competition with a high number of F. rupicola individuals. In contrast, F. rupicola did not show any significant differences in performance with increasing presence of D. carthusianorum, and the RNE switched from neutral interaction to facilitation. In the second year after sowing, the performance of D. carthusianorum in the various treatments did not differ, except for the length of the flowering stems. The simulation of land use practices did not affect the performance of D. carthusianorum, but F. rupicola showed significant differences in biomass and in length of the panicles, as was the case also between monocultures and mixtures. The performance of the grass species was clearly improved in the unclipped treatments. The RNE reflected competition against D. carthusianorum which became reduced in unclipped treatments, while F. rupicola became facilitated. There were no interactions between the different treatments (monocultures and mixtures) and the simulated land use change (clipped and unclipped). Our data suggest that although traditional land use practices, i.e. grazing and mowing, do not affect the development of D. carthusianorum, the abandonment of these practices has improved F. rupicola performance, which has led to the increasingly invasive character of this grass species over the last 20 years. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to examine preservice elementary school teachers' geometry learning as investigated by both qualitative and quantitative methods. For the qualitative investigation, narrative analysis and thematic analysis methods were used. The findings of narrative analysis indicated two main kinds of stories: as a learner and as a beginning teacher. The thematic analysis findings yield to three themes: history of learning geometry, perceptions about geometry, effective geometry instructional practices. The findings informed the quantitative investigation on geometry content knowledge for the case of quadrilaterals. During the second phase of the study, 102 participants who enrolled in the methods course completed pre and post test of teachers' geometry content knowledge. Treatment group participants (n=54) received series of activities (geometry activities and student work analysis) focusing on quadrilaterals, and control group participants (n=48) received traditional instruction. Repeated measures ANOVA results showed a significant change in treatment group participants' geometry content knowledge. The mixed ANOVA results indicated a significant main effect of knowledge but no significant interaction between geometry content knowledge and grouping. Even though treatment group participants' geometry content knowledge growth was significant, the difference between treatment group and control group participants' growth in geometry content knowledge was not significant. This study informs mathematics teacher education in three important areas; limited knowledge of preservice teachers' geometry content knowledge, integrating mathematics content and the context of teaching into methods course, and use of student work with preservice teachers.},

abstract = {Living roots and their rhizodeposits can stimulate microbial activity and soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition up to several folds. This so-called rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) varies widely among plant species possibly due to species-specific differences in the quality and quantity of rhizodeposits and other root functions. However, whether the RPE is influenced by plant inter-species interactions remains largely unexplored, even though these interactions can fundamentally shape plant functions such as carbon allocation and nutrient uptake.In a 60-day greenhouse experiment, we continuously labeled monocultures and mixtures of sunflower, soybean and wheat with 13C-depleted CO2 and partitioned total CO2 efflux released from soil at two stages of plant development for SOM- and root-derived CO2. The RPE was calculated as the difference in SOM-derived CO2 between the planted and the unplanted soil, and was compared among the monocultures and mixtures.We found that the RPE was positive under all plants, ranging from 43% to 136% increase above the unplanted control. There were no significant differences in RPE at the vegetative stage. At the flowering stage however, the RPE in the soybean-wheat mixture was significantly higher than those in the sunflower monoculture, the sunflower-wheat mixture, and the sunflower-soybean mixture. These results indicated that the influence of plant inter-specific interactions on the RPE is case-specific and phenology-dependent. To evaluate the intensity of inter-specific effects on priming, we calculated an expected RPE for the mixtures based on the RPE of the monocultures weighted by their root biomass and compared it to the measured RPE under mixtures. At flowering, the measured RPE was significantly lower for the sunflower-wheat mixture than what can be expected from their monocultures, suggesting that RPE was significantly reduced by the inter-species effects of sunflower and wheat. In summary, our results clearly demonstrated that inter-species interactions can significantly modify rhizosphere priming on SOM decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Traditional Mexican coffee plantations, with a diverse shade vegetation of native tree species, are being replaced by coffee monocultures shaded by trees of the genus Inga, resulting in loss of biodiversity and ecological services. Coffee production is said to benefit from Inga shade, but few on-field experiments have been done to support this hypothesis. Secondary production (timber, firewood, fruits, medicines, etc.) is probably lower in Inga-shaded coffee plantations, and that loss could outweigh benefits from increased coffee production. Coffee yields, present stock of timber, and aboveground tree biomass as an indicator of firewood production were measured and compared for plots in traditional and in Inga-shaded plantations in Plan Pared{\'{o}}n, Chiapas, Mexico. Coffee production was similar in both plantation types. Timber production was significantly higher in traditional plantations, and amounted to ten times the timber production in Inga-shaded plantations. Total tree biomass was significantly higher in traditional coffee plantations, but not biomass of tree species apt for firewood. However, firewood production could be higher in traditional plantations. There seems to be no reason to replace traditional plantations by Inga-shaded ones in order to increase production in the plantations studied. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Human activities affect both tree species composition and diversity in forested ecosystems. This in turn alters the species diversity of plant litter and litter quality, which may have cascading effects on soil microbial communities and their functions for decomposition and nutrient cycling. We tested microbial responses to litter species diversity in a leaf litter decomposition experiment including monocultures, 2-, and 4-species mixtures in the subtropical climate zone of southeastern China. Soil microbial community composition was assessed by lipid analysis, and microbial functions were measured using extracellular enzyme activity and gross rates of nitrogen mineralization. We observed a positive relationship between litter species diversity and abundances of mycorrhizal fungi and actinomycetes. Alternatively, enzyme activities involved in carbon and phosphorus acquisition, and enzyme indices of relative carbon limitation, were higher only in the 4-species mixtures. This suggests that the minimum basal substrate level for enzyme production was reached, or that limitation was higher, at the highest diversity level only. Responses to litter diversity also changed over time, where phosphatase responses to litter diversity were strongest early in decomposition and the indices of carbon limitation relative to other nutrients showed stronger responses later in decomposition. Enzyme activities were related to lipid biomarker data and the mass of litter remaining at the third time point, but relationships between enzyme activity and the mass of litter remaining were not consistent across other time points. We conclude that litter species richness will likely only reduce microbial functions at key intervals of diversity loss while microbial growth is more sensitive to incremental diversity loss, with no clear relationships between them or to ecosystem functions. The observed litter diversity effects on soil microbial biomass and enzyme activity indicate interactions of aboveground and belowground communities, and together with environmental conditions they are important for maintaining ecosystem functions. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract = {Background and aims Soil aggregate stability depends on plant community properties, such as functional group composition, diversity and biomass production. However, little is known about the relative importance of these drivers and the role of soil organisms in mediating plant community effects. Methods We studied soil aggregate stability in an ex- perimental grassland plant diversity gradient and considered sidered several explanatory variables to mechanistically explain effects of plant diversity and plant functional group composition. Three soil aggregate stability mea- sures (slaking, mechanical breakdown and micro- cracking) were considered in path analyses. Results Soil aggregate stability increased signifi- cantly from monocultures to plant species mixtures and in the presence of grasses, while it decreased in the presence of legumes, though effects differed somewhat between soil aggregate stability mea- sures. Using path analysis plant community effects could be explained by variations in root biomass, soil microbial biomass, soil organic carbon con- centrations (all positive relationships), and earth- worm biomass (negative relationship with mechan- ical breakdown). Conclusions The present study identified important drivers of plant community effects on soil aggregate stability. The effects of root biomass, soil microbial biomass, and soil organic carbon concentrations were largely consistent across plant diversity levels suggesting that the mechanisms identified are of gen- eral relevance.},

abstract = {The ability of restoration approaches to provide valued ecosystem services needs to be assessed. The emerging carbon market provides an incentive to afforest agricultural landscapes and could potentially achieve multiple outcomes. However, planting monocultures for carbon sequestration may preclude effective delivery of other ecosystem services. Here, we describe the rationale behind the Ridgefield Multiple Ecosystem Services Experiment, a long-term investigation into trade-offs that might prevent the simultaneous provision of high levels of multiple services in the agricultural landscape of south-western Australia. We compare a monoculture treatment of a fast growing native species (Eucalyptus loxophleba) with mixtures of 2, 4 or 8 native plant species. We selected species based on different traits that we predict will relate to the provision of different levels of multiple ecosystem services. We ask: Can restoration of multiple ecosystem services be achieved along with carbon sequestration? Nested treatments of nitrogen deposition and weed removal test whether ecosystem service outcomes respond to environmental changes. We show that historical land-use at the site has the potential to affect service delivery via different soil characteristics and survival of planted species. Ridgefield tests the possibility of restoring and managing agricultural landscapes for multiple ecosystem services, providing a much needed experimental investigation of trade-offs among ecosystem functions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cropping systems that rely on renewable energy and resources and are based on ecological principles could be more stable and productive into the future than current monoculture systems with serious unintended environmental consequences such as soil erosion and water pollution. In nonagricultural systems, communities with higher species diversity have higher productivity and provide other ecosystem services. However, communities of well-adapted crop species selected for biomass production may respond differently to increasing diversity. Diversity effects may be due to complementarity among species (complementary resource use and facilitative interactions) or positive selection effects (e.g., species with higher productivity dominate the mixture), and these effects may change over time or across environments. Our goal was to identify the ecological mechanisms causing diversity effects in a biodiversity experiment using agriculturally relevant species, and evaluate the implications for the design of sustainable cropping systems. We seeded seven perennial forage species in a replicated field experiment at two locations in Iowa, USA, and evaluated biomass productivity of monocultures and two- to six-species mixtures over 3 years after the establishment year under management systems of contrasting intensity: one or three harvests per year. Productivity increased with seeded species richness in all environments, and the positive relationship did not change over time. Polyculture overyielding was due to complementarity among species in the community rather than to selection effects of individual species. Complementarity increased as a log-linear function of species richness in all environments, and this trend was consistent across years. Legume–grass facilitation may explain much of this complementarity effect. Although individual species with high biomass production had a major effect on productivity of mixtures, the species producing the highest biomass in monoculture changed over the years in most environments. Furthermore, transgressive overyielding was observed and was more prevalent in later years, in some environments. We conclude that choosing a single well-adapted species for maximizing productivity may not be the best alternative over the long term and that high levels of species diversity should be included in the design of productive and ecologically sound agricultural systems.},

abstract = {The symbiotic microbes that grow in and on many organisms can play important roles in protecting their hosts from pathogen infection. While species diversity has been shown to influence community function in many other natural systems, the question of how species diversity of host-associated symbiotic microbes contributes to pathogen resistance is just beginning to be explored. Understanding diversity effects on pathogen resistance could be particularly helpful in combating the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) which has caused dramatic population declines in many amphibian species and is a major concern for amphibian conservation. Our study investigates the ability of host-associated bacteria to inhibit the proliferation of Bd when grown in experimentally assembled biofilm communities that differ in species number and composition. Six bacterial species isolated from the skin of Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae) were used to assemble bacterial biofilm communities containing 1, 2, 3, or all 6 bacterial species. Biofilm communities were grown with Bd for 7 days following inoculation. More speciose bacterial communities reduced Bd abundance more effectively. This relationship between bacterial species richness and Bd suppression appeared to be driven by dominance effects—the bacterial species that were most effective at inhibiting Bd dominated multi-species communities—and complementarity: multi-species communities inhibited Bd growth more than monocultures of constituent species. These results underscore the notion that pathogen resistance is an emergent property of microbial communities, a consideration that should be taken into account when designing probiotic treatments to reduce the impacts of infectious disease.},

abstract = {Heterospecific neighbors may reduce damage to a focal plant by lowering specialist herbivore loads (associational resistance hypothesis), or enhance damage by increasing generalist herbivore loads (associational susceptibility hypothesis). We tested the associational effects of tree diversity on herbivory patterns of the tropical focal tree Tabebuia rosea in an experimental plantation setup, which contained tree monocultures and mixed stands. We found higher herbivore damage to T. rosea at higher tree diversity, indicating that T. rosea did not benefit from associational resistance but rather experienced associational susceptibility. The specific consideration of the two dominant insect herbivore species of T. rosea, the specialist chrysomelid Walterianella inscripta and the specialist pyralid Eulepte gastralis, facilitated understanding of the detected damage patterns. Tree diversity exerted opposite effects on tree infestation by the two herbivores. These findings point to resource concentration effects for the chrysomelid beetle (favored by tree monoculture) and to resource dilution effects for the pyralid caterpillar (favored by tree mixture) as underlying mechanisms of herbivore distribution. A strong contribution of the pyralid to overall damage patterns in diversified stands suggests that associational susceptibility may not necessarily be related to higher abundances of generalist herbivores but may also result from specialized herbivores affected by resource dilution effects. Thus, the identity and biology of herbivore species has to be taken into account when attempting to predict damage patterns in forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {Plantations of native timber species established on former pasture are a potential strategy to reduce the logging pressure on remnant natural forests in the tropics. Such plantations may help to mitigate or reverse the negative impacts of land degradation, and they may contribute to the long-term livelihood of livestock farmers. Planting native trees is, however, perceived as a risky activity due to limited knowledge of their performance and due to marked losses of newly established seedlings attributed to insect pests. Our study focuses on the small-scale effects of environmental heterogeneity, tree diversity and insecticide treatment on the performance of three native Central American timber species two years after establishment, and on damage inflicted by insect herbivores. Growth, survival and herbivore leaf damage were quantified for Anacardium excelsum (Anacardiaceae), Cedrela odorata (Meliaceae) and Tabebuia rosea (Bignoniaceae) planted in an experiment in Panama as (1) monocultures, (2) mixed stands, and (3) mixed stands protected by insecticides. Our study revealed that small-scale effects can have a substantial impact on the success of timber trees planted on former pasture. Growth performance and survival of the three species was strongly affected by small-scale environmental heterogeneity, which was expressed as significant differences in growth and survival among different plantation plots at the same study site. Establishment of trees in mixed stands did not have significant effects on tree survival and growth compared to pure stands, although it reduced herbivore pressure in one of the studied tree species. All tree species grew best and suffered lowest leaf damage when protected by insecticides, indicating a general influence of insect herbivory on growth of newly established trees. In contrast to growth performance, survival was not significantly affected by different management practices or herbivory. The large variability among plots in tree survival and growth, and also in the effects of management practices such as planting design and insecticide treatment, emphasizes the importance of small-scale environmental heterogeneity on tree survival and growth. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Despite the progress made in explaining trophic interactions through the stoichiometric interplay between consumers and resources, it remains unclear how the number of species in a trophic group influences the effects of elemental imbalances in food webs. Therefore, we conducted a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that multispecies producer assemblages alter the nutrient dynamics in a pelagic community. Four algal species were reared in mono-and polycultures under a 2 3 2 factorial combination of light and nutrient supply, thereby contrasting the stoichiometry of trophic interactions involving single vs. multiple producer species. After 9 d, these cultures were fed to the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa, and we monitored biomass, resource use, and C:N:P stoichiometry in both phyto-and zooplankton. According to our expectations, light and N supply resulted in gradients of phytoplankton biomass and nutrient composition (C:N:P). Significant net diversity effects for algal biomass and C:N:P ratios reflected the greater responsiveness of the phytoplankton polyculture to altered resource supply compared to monocultures. These alterations of elemental ratios were common, and were partly triggered by changes in species frequency in the mixtures and partly by diversity-related changes in resource use. Copepod individual biomass increased under high light (HL) and N-reduced ({\`{A}}N) conditions, when food was high in C:N but low in C:P and N:P, whereas copepod growth was obviously P limited, and copepod stoichiometry was not affected by phytoplankton elemental composition. Correspondingly, copepod individual biomass reflected significant net diversity effects: compared to expectations derived from monocultures, copepod individuals feeding on algal polycultures remained smaller than predicted under HL and N-sufficient (þN) conditions but grew larger than predicted under HL, {\`{A}}N and low light þN conditions.

abstract = {Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) and leaf morphology were assessed in two sites in Europe (Kaltenborn, Germany, and Satakunta, Finland) within a forest diversity experiment. Trees at Satakunta, planted in 1999, form a stratified canopy, while in Kaltenborn the trees are 7 years old, with no apparent canopy connection among broadleaf species. The following ChlF parameters from measured OJIP transient curves were examined: F(V)/F(M) (a proxy for maximum quantum yield); $\Psi$Eo (a proxy for efficiency in transferring an electron from reduced QA to the electron transport chain); I-P phase (a proxy for efficiency of reducing final acceptors beyond PSI); and PItot (total performance index for potential energy conservation from photons absorbed by PSII to reduction of PSI end acceptors). At Satakunta F(V)/F(M) and $\Psi$Eo in Betula pendula were higher in monocultures and lower in mixed plots, perhaps due to increasing light availability in mixed plots, which can induce photoinhibition. The opposite trend was observed in Picea abies, which was shaded in mixed plots. At Kaltenborn F(V)/F(M) decreased in Fagus sylvatica and P. abies in mixed plots due to competition both above- and belowground. At Satakunta LMA increased in B. pendula leaves with increasing species richness. Leaf area of ten leaves was reduced in F. sylvatica in mixed plots at Kaltenborn. By up-scaling the overall fluorescence response to plot level (PItot_plot ), a significant positive correlation with tree diversity was found at Kaltenborn, but not at Satakunta. This could suggest that competition/facilitation processes in mixed stands play a significant role in the early stages of forest establishment, but then tend to be compensated in more mature stands.},

abstract = {Abstract Plant species richness influences primary productivity via mechanisms that (1) favour species with particular traits (selection effect) and (2) promote niche differentiation between species (complementarity). Influences of species evenness, plant density and other properties of plant communities on productivity are poorly defined, but may depend on whether selection or complementarity prevails in species mixtures. We predicted that selection effects are insensitive to species evenness but increase with plant density, and that the converse is true for complementarity. To test predictions, we grew three species of annuals in monocultures and in three-species mixtures in which evenness of established plants was varied at each of three plant densities in a cultivated field in Texas, USA. Above-ground biomass was smaller in mixtures than expected from monocultures because of negative ‘complementarity' and a negative selection effect. Neither selection nor complementarity varied with species evenness, but selection effects increased at the greatest plant density as predicted.},

abstract = {Many biofilm populations are known for their exceptional biodiversity, but the relative contributions of the forces that could produce this diversity are poorly understood. This uncertainty grows in the old, well-established communities found on many natural surfaces and in long-term, chronic infections. If the prevailing interactions among species within biofilms are positive, productivity should increase with diversity, but if they tend towards competition or antagonism, productivity should decrease. Here, we describe the parallel evolution of synergistic communities derived from a clone of Burkholderia cenocepacia during $\sim$1500 generations of biofilm selection. This long-term evolution was enabled by a new experimental method that selects for daily cycles of colonization, biofilm assembly and dispersal. Each of the six replicate biofilm populations underwent a common pattern of adaptive morphological diversification, in which three ecologically distinct morphotypes arose in the same order of succession and persisted. In two focal populations, mixed communities were more productive than any monoculture and each variant benefited from the mixture. These gains in output resulted from asymmetrical cross-feeding between ecotypes and the expansion and partitioning of biofilm space that constructed new niches. Therefore, even in the absence of starting genetic variation, prolonged selection for surface colonization generates a dynamic of ecological succession that enhances productivity.},

abstract = {Productivity-diversity relationships are routinely described mainly in terms of species richness. However, these relationships can be affected by the functional strategy and physiological plasticity characterizing each species as they respond to environment and management changes. This study, therefore, aimed to analyze species interactions in grass communities presenting the same number of species (n = 6) but different growth strategies, and the impact on community productivity across several forms of field management (two different fertilizer application rates, i.e. 120 and 360 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), and two cutting frequencies, i.e. 3 and 6 cuts per year). For this purpose, we applied the tripartite partitioning method introduced for the analysis of biodiversity effects (BE). Grass species were cultivated on small plots (4.2 m(2)) in both mixtures and monocultures. Different management regimes altered both net BE and its component effects: dominance and potential for complementarity. A higher cutting frequency significantly reduced net BE, via a reduction in dominance effect. We found that increased N supply could either increase or decrease complementary effect according to grass mixture composition, i.e. species strategy. Regardless of management intensity, net BE was in general significantly positive especially when including individual species-specific plasticity effects. We conclude that a combination of different grasses has a positive effect on community biomass. Furthermore, both the functional strategy and the functional plasticity of component species play an important role in the intensity of BE. Therefore, biological mechanisms leading to enhanced biomass in six-grass communities are as effective for productivity as management conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During their domestication, maize, bean and squash evolved in polycultures grown by small-scale farmers in the Americas. Polycultures often overyield on low-fertility soils, which are a primary production constraint in low-input agriculture. We hypothesized that root architectural differences among these crops causes niche complementarity and thereby greater nutrient acquisition than corresponding monocultures.\n\nMETHODS: A functional-structural plant model, SimRoot, was used to simulate the first 40 d of growth of these crops in monoculture and polyculture and to determine the effects of root competition on nutrient uptake and biomass production of each plant on low-nitrogen, -phosphorus and -potassium soils.\n\nKEY RESULTS: Squash, the earliest domesticated crop, was most sensitive to low soil fertility, while bean, the most recently domesticated crop, was least sensitive to low soil fertility. Nitrate uptake and biomass production were up to 7 % greater in the polycultures than in the monocultures, but only when root architecture was taken into account. Enhanced nitrogen capture in polycultures was independent of nitrogen fixation by bean. Root competition had negligible effects on phosphorus or potassium uptake or biomass production.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that spatial niche differentiation caused by differences in root architecture allows polycultures to overyield when plants are competing for mobile soil resources. However, direct competition for immobile resources might be negligible in agricultural systems. Interspecies root spacing may also be too large to allow maize to benefit from root exudates of bean or squash. Above-ground competition for light, however, may have strong feedbacks on root foraging for immobile nutrients, which may increase cereal growth more than it will decrease the growth of the other crops. We note that the order of domestication of crops correlates with increasing nutrient efficiency, rather than production potential.},

abstract = {We developed an analytical method that quantifies the relative contributions of mortality and individual growth to ecosystem function and analysed the results from the first biodiversity experiment conducted in a tropical tree plantation. In Sardinilla, central Panama, over 5000 tree seedlings were planted in monoculture and mixed-species plots. After 5 years of growth, mixed-species plots yielded, on average, 30-58% higher summed tree basal area than did monocultures. Simulation models revealed that the increased yield of mixed-species plots was due mostly to enhancement of individual tree growth. Although c. 1500 trees died during the experiment, mortality was highly species-specific and did not differ consistently between biodiversity treatments. Our results show that the effects of biodiversity on growth and mortality are uncoupled and that biodiversity affects total biomass and potentially self-thinning. The Sardinilla experiment suggests that mixed-species plantings may be a viable strategy for increasing timber yields and preserving biodiversity in tropical tree plantations.},

abstract = {This paper presents a synthesis of experiments conducted in a tropical tree plantation established in 2001 and consisting of 22 plots of 45m×45m with either one, three or six native tree species. We examined the changes in carbon (C) pools (trees, herbaceous vegetation, litter, coarse woody debris (CWD), and mineral topsoil at 0-10cm depth) and fluxes (decomposition of CWD and litter, as well as soil respiration) both through time and among diversity levels. Between 2001 and 2009 the aboveground C pools increased, driven by trees. Across diversity levels, the mean observed aboveground C pool was 7.9±2.5Mgha-1in 2006 and 20.4±7.4Mgha-1in 2009, a 158% increase. There was no significant diversity effect on the observed aboveground C pool, but we found a significant decrease in the topsoil C pool, with a mean value of 34.5±2.4Mgha-1in 2001 and of 25.7±5.7Mgha-1in 2009 (F1,36=52.12, p<0.001). Assuming that the biomass C pool in 2001 was negligible (<1Mgha-1), then the plantation gained in C, on average, ∼20 and lost ∼9Mgha-1in biomass and soil respectively, for an overall gain of ∼11Mgha-1over 8 years. Across the entire data set, we uncovered significant effects of diversity on CWD decomposition (diversity: F2,393=15.93, p<0.001) and soil respiration (monocultures vs mixtures: t=15.35, df=11, p<0.05) and a marginally significant time×diversity interaction on the loss of total C from the mineral topsoil pool (see above). Monthly CWD decomposition was significantly faster in monocultures (35.0±24.1%) compared with triplets (31.3±21.0%) and six-species mixtures (31.9±26.8%), while soil respiration was higher in monocultures than in mixtures (t=15.35, df=11, p<0.001). Path analyses showed that, as diversity increases, the links among the C pools and fluxes strengthen significantly. Our results demonstrate that tree diversity influences the processes governing the changes in C pools and fluxes following establishment of a tree plantation on a former pasture. We conclude that the choice of tree mixtures for afforestation in the tropics can have a marked influence on C pools and dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aims Post-dispersal seed predation is an important ecosystem process because it can influence the seed's fate after the initial dispersal from the mother plant and subsequently transform communities. Even at small scales, post-dispersal seed predation can vary greatly depending on seed identity, granivorous taxa or microhabitat structure. However, little is known about the role of plant species richness and functional group richness in post-dispersal seed predation. The overall aim of this study was to test whether increasing plant species richness or plant functional group richness affects the rate and variability of post-dispersal seed predation. We additionally investigated the influence of vegetation structure and seed species identity on the rate and variability of post-dispersal seed predation and whether the influence of different granivorous taxa changed with increasing plant species richness. Methods We conducted seed removal experiments along a long-term experimental plant diversity gradient, comprising plots with monocultures to 60 species mixtures of common grassland species in Jena, Germany, in August 2011. We studied seeds of Onobrychis viciifolia, Pastinaca sativa and Trifolium pratense in exclusion experiments (seed cafeterias), an experimental setup that allowed access either for arthropods or slugs or for all granivorous taxa. Traditionally, seeds removed from seed cafeterias were classified as consumed but we used traceable fluorescent-coloured seeds to obtain more accurate predation rates by subtracting recovered seeds from overall removed seeds. The effect of multiple vegetation variables on mean and variability of seed predation rates was analysed using generalized mixed-effect models and linear regressions, respectively. Important Findings Rates of recovered seeds were low but contributed to significant differences between seed predation rates and removal rates of seeds in some treatments. Seed predation rates were not directly correlated with increasing plant species richness or plant functional group richness but were influenced byseed species identity and granivorous taxa. Vegetation variables such as vegetation height and cover were significantly associated with seed predation rates. Depending on the seed species and/or the granivorous taxa, different vegetation variables correlated with seed predation rates. Our results indicate that effects of plant functional group richness and multiple vegetation variables on the magnitude of post-dispersal seed predation varied with seed identity and seed predator taxa. A direct effect of plant species and plant functional group richness could be shown on the variability of post-dispersal seed predation for some seed species and their respective predators. Thus, the changes in magnitude of post-dispersal seed predation with increasing plant species richness could potentially impact the fitness of some plant species and thereby influence plant community structure.},

abstract = {Sustainable forest management of commercial monoculture plantations may be difficult to achieve in plantations of Monterrey pine because these commercial monocultures are managed under a clear cutting system, where the understory vegetation is initially damaged by harvesting, and subsequently, by herbicide application. Despite its marked structural changes following harvesting, the ecological role of understory in mitigating the negative impact of clear cutting on biodiversity is scarcely known. We test for the positive effect of the understory vegetation present in clearcut pine stands on the abundance and movement ability of the Chestnut-throated Huet-Huet (Pteroptochos castaneus), an insectivorous bird sensitive to adult pine plantations with scarce understory cover. Abundance was assessed through passive and broadcasting surveys during reproductive and pos-reproductive season at native forests, mature pine stands and cleacut areas. Movement was experimentally assessed as the willingness of individual Huet-Huets to enter into clearcuts from adjacent mature pint stands of native forest. The understory vegetation was the main predictor of P. castaneus abundance in native forest and mature pine plantations, but not into clearcut stands. Although Huet-Huets tended to be reluctant to enter into clearcuttings, their displacement into clearcuttings was positively influenced by the understory present in both the clearcut stands and the habitats where they had been experimentally attracted by playbacks (i.e., native forest or mature pine). We conclude that the conservation of P. castaneus in forest plantations involves modifying the traditional clearcutting system into a forest management that minimizes the use of herbicides while promoting the retention of understory vegetation and woody debris.},

abstract = {The diversity of many communities is changing due to local extinctions and invasions. Understanding the consequences of these changes is vital to their successful conservation, yet few studies have experimentally investigated how producer diversity affects the stability of higher trophic levels. Here, we show that producer diversity, when manipulated as the only independent variable in the presence of natural top-down forces, increases the stability of consumer abundance, biomass and diversity in a benthic marine community. Using four macroalgal species (Codium fragile, Gracilaria tikvahiae, Gracilaria vermiculophylla and Gymnogongrus griffithsiae), we manipulated producer diversity (identity and richness) in a substitutive design to create seven treatments. Our treatments included four monocultures, two 3-species mixtures that differed only by including either the native or invasive Gracilaria and the complete four-species mixture. We followed the week-to-week dynamics of producer and consumer communities in each treatment concurrently for 12weeks and quantified their temporal stability. We found that higher producer diversity increased the stability of a diverse, productive consumer community.Producer biomass production did not affect consumer production or diversity, suggesting that producer diversity was solely responsible for driving the mechanisms underlying the observed multitrophic diversity-stability relationships. Taken together, our results indicate thathigher producer diversitydirectly increased consumer diversity by increasing overyielding and decreasing the temporal variance of this response variable and that this increased consumer diversity enhanced consumer stability via increased asynchrony among consumers.Synthesis. Our results suggest that the effects of producer diversity propagate upwards to maintain diversity and productivity at higher trophic levels, and thereby enhance the overall stability of food webs.},

Reduced biodiversity has raised numerous concerns, including the possibility that ecosystem functioning may be affected negatively, which might be particularly important in the face of other global changes. Here we present results of a grassland field experiment in Minnesota, USA, that tests the hypothesis that plant diversity and composition influence the enhancement of biomass and carbon acquisition in ecosystems subjected to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition. The study experimentally controlled plant diversity (1, 4, 9 or 16 species), soil nitrogen (unamended versus deposition of 4 g of nitrogen per m2 per yr) and atmospheric CO2 concentrations using free-air CO2 enrichment (ambient, 368 micromol mol-1, versus elevated, 560 micromol mol-1).

abstract = {Aims We explore the potential effect of plant diversity on yield and greenhouse gas exchanges in forage mix- tures, identifying potential co-benefits between functions. Methods Using the biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) modelling framework (Connolly et al. 2013), we analyse results from a field experiment where the relative sown proportion of three forage species (a grass, a legume, and a non-legume forb) was varied to obtain a gradient in species proportions and evenness. The exchange rates of N2O, CH4,NH3 and CO2 were mea- sured, together with forage yield and soil inorganic N content. We conducted gas measurements 4 years after sward establishment during the expected period of highest emissions. Results Results support the hypothesis that emission rates are affected by plant diversity. Sown evenness was found to decrease N2O exchange rates, and some evidence was found for a similar negative effect onCH4. Plant composition affected gas exchanges, with legume monocultures showing the highest emission rates for all gases. Diversity also increased yield and modulated NO3 − and NH4 + soil concentrations. Conclusions The integrated analysis of yield and emis- sion response to species diversity allows the identifica- tion of a range of species proportions for which both functions are optimized. Diversifying forage legume- based systems could contribute to mitigation while im- proving ecosystem productivity.},

abstract = {The ability of soil microbial communities to withstand and recover from disturbance or stress is important for the functional stability of forest ecosystems. However, the relationship between the community responses of soil microbes and variation in tree mixtures vs functional composition remains poorly understood. We investigated soil biochemical properties and soil microbial resistance and resilience to drought in three 4-year old tree monocultures (Acer saccharum Marsh, Larix laricina (Duroi) K. Koch, Pinus strobus L.) and two tree species combinations (L. laricina/A. saccharum and L. laricina/P. strobus) planted in a high-density tree field experiment located in southern Quebec, Canada. The experimentally imposed drought stress consisted of maintaining soil material for 30 days at 25% of water holding capacity (WHC). Microbial biomass was assessed immediately after the water stress (resistance) and 15 and 30 days following drought (resilience). Results showed that tree communities influenced soil chemistry, soil respirometry properties and microbial resistance and resilience. We measured significant non-additive (i.e., both synergistic and antagonistic) effects of mixing tree species in some of the soil biochemical properties measured, mostly in the L. laricina/A. saccharum mixture. However, we did not find non-additive effects of tree mixtures on microbial resistance and resilience. A structural equation modelling analysis revealed that resistance and resilience were mostly modulated by direct effects of community weight means (CWM) of leaf litter lignin content and mineralisable N, and by indirect links from tree density and CWM of leaf litter N content via mineralisable N. This study suggests that tree species identity surpassed species mixtures as a key driver of soil microbial resistance and resilience. We showed a trade-off between microbial resistance and resilience in soil food webs, which is consistent with ecological theory. Our results indicate that differences in functional traits between tree species may rapidly be reflected in divergent soil biochemical properties, and that these differences can in turn drive soil microbial resistance and resilience to drought.

abstract = {A positive relationship between plant species richness and ecosystem functioning has been found in a number of experimental studies. Positive species interactions at high species numbers have been suggested as a cause, but mechanisms driving positive interactions have not often been tested. In this experiment we asked three questions: (1) What is the relationship between species richness and productivity in experimentally constructed moss communities? (2) Is this relationship affected by plant density? and (3) Can changes in moisture absorption and retention explain observed relationships? To answer these questions we exposed arctic tundra moss communities of different species richness levels (1-11 species) and two different densities in the greenhouse to two levels of drought (short and long). Biomass (by the community and individual species), height and community moisture absorption and retention were measured as response variables. High species diversity increased productivity (more so in low-density plots than in high-density plots), but only when plots were watered regularly. Plot moisture retention was improved at high species richness as well, and plant height and variation in height was increased compared to plants in monoculture. Under high-density and short-drought conditions 10 out of 12 species grew better in mixture than in monoculture, but under the long drought treatment only six species did. A positive feedback loop between biomass and improved humidity under high diversity was supported by path analysis. We conclude that in this community the relationship between species richness and productivity depends on moisture availability and density, with improved water absorption and retention likely to be the mechanism for increased plant growth when drought periods are short. Furthermore, since this is the opposite of what has been found for temperate moss communities, conclusions from one system cannot automatically be extrapolated to other systems.},

abstract = {Species diversity is important for a range of ecosystem processes and properties, including the resistance to single and multiple stressors. It has been suggested that genetic diversity may play a similar role, but empirical evidence is still relatively scarce. Here, we report the results of a microcosm experiment where four strains of the marine diatom Skeletonema marinoi were grown in monoculture and in mixture under a factorial combination of temperature and salinity stress. The strains differed in their susceptibility to the two stressors and no strain was able to survive both stressors simultaneously. Strong competition between the genotypes resulted in the dominance of one strain under both control and salinity stress conditions. The overall productivity of the mixture, however, was not related to the dominance of this strain, but was instead dependent on the treatment; under control conditions we observed a positive effect of genetic richness, whereas a negative effect was observed in the stress treatments. This suggests that interactions among the strains can be both positive and negative, depending on the abiotic environment. Our results provide additional evidence that the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship is also relevant at the level of genetic diversity.},

abstract = {Increasing productivity of mixtures as compared to monocultures has been reported from numerous experimental studies, but so far the variable contribution of individual species to higher mixture productivity in biodiversity experiments is not well understood. To address this issue, we quantified the productivity of 60 species in monocultures and mixtures of varying species richness (2, 4, 8, 16, 60) and functional group number and composition (1, 2, 3, 4; legumes, grasses, small herbs, tall herbs) and tested how species properties are related to species performance in mixtures in the third year after sowing. We analysed monoculture biomass, plant biomass from separately grown plant individuals (=estimate of plant growth rates), and the monoculture resource-use characteristics canopy height and structure (leaf area index) as indicators for light acquisition, and soil nitrate concentration (=estimate of depletion of plant available nitrogen) and biomass:N ratios (=estimate of biomass produced per unit plant N) as indicators for nitrogen acquisition and use. High monoculture productivity was related to different combinations of resource-use characteristics. The biomass of a species and its proportional contribution to mixture biomass correlated positively with species relative yields, suggesting that highly productive mixture species were most important for an overyielding of mixtures. Although monoculture biomass was a significant predictor for species performance in mixtures except for grasses, a combination of monoculture biomass, plant growth rates and resource-use traits associated with nutrient and light acquisition explained non-legume species performance best. Legume performance was best associated with their monoculture biomass and traits associated with light acquisition. In spite of the fact that high species performance in mixtures was associated with a species' competitive ability as represented by monoculture productivity, growth rates and resource-use traits, our results suggest that species uniqueness in resource acquisition strategies increases the chance for niche differentiation among overyielding species. {\textcopyright} 2010 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

abstract = {Positive species richness–productivity rela- tionships are common in biodiversity experiments, but how resource availability modifies biodiversity effects in grass–legume mixtures composed of highly productive spe- cies is yet to be explicitly tested. We addressed this ques- tion by choosing two grasses (Arrhenatherum elatius and Dactylis glomerata) and two legumes (Medicago × varia and Onobrychis viciifolia) which are highly productive in monocultures and dominant in mixtures (the Jena Experi- ment). We established monocultures, all possible two- and three-species mixtures, and the four-species mixture under three different resource supply conditions (control, fertili- zation, and shading). Compared to the control, community biomass production decreased under shading (−56 %) and increased under fertilization (+12 %). Net diversity effects (i.e., mixture minus mean monoculture biomass) were positive in the control and under shading (on average +15 and +72 %, respectively) and negative under fertilization (−10 %). Positive complementarity effects in the control suggested resource partitioning and facilitation of growth through symbiotic N2 fixation by legumes. Positive com- plementarity effects under shading indicated that resource partitioning is also possible when growth is carbon-limited. Negative complementarity effects under fertilization sug- gested that external nutrient supply depressed facilitative grass–legume interactions due to increased competition for light. Selection effects, which quantify the dominance of species with particularly high monoculture biomasses in the mixture, were generally small compared to complemen- tarity effects, and indicated that these species had compara- ble competitive strengths in the mixture. Our study shows that resource availability has a strong impact on the occur- rence of positive diversity effects among tall and highly productive grass and legume species.},

The experimental design explicitly addresses criticisms provoked by previous biodiversity experiments. In particular, the choice of functional groups, the statistical separation of sampling versus complementarity effects, and testing for the effects of particular functional groups differ from previous experiments. Based on a species pool of 60 plant species common to the Central European Arrhenatherion grasslands, mixtures of one to 16 (60) species and of one to four plant functional groups were established on 90 plots (20 m × 20 m) with nested experiments. In order to test specific hypotheses 390 additional small-area plots (3.5 m × 3.5 m) were set-up. Exact replicates of all species mixtures serve to assess the variability in ecosystem responses. In a dominance experiment, the effects of interactions among nine selected highly productive species are studied. Each species is grown as monoculture replicated once.},

In an experiment with grassland communities of varying species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 60 species) and functional group richness (1, 2, 3, and 4 functional groups), we used different cultivars of Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) to study effects of biodiversity and cultivar identity on the occurrence and severity of foliar fungal diseases caused by Puccinia coronata (crown rust) and P. graminis (stem rust). Cultivar monocultures of perennial ryegrass revealed strong differences in pathogen susceptibility among these cultivars. Disease intensity caused by both rust fungi decreased significantly with growing species richness of species mixtures. The response to the diversity gradient was related to the decreased density and size of the host individuals with increasing species richness. The occurrence of other grass species known to be possible hosts of the pathogens in the experimental mixtures did not promote disease intensity in L. perenne, indicating that there was a high host specificity of pathogen strains. Differences in pathogen susceptibility among perennial ryegrass cultivars persisted independent of diversity treatment, host density and host individual size, but resulted in a cultivar-specific pattern of changes in pathogen infestation across the species-richness gradient. Our study provided evidence that within-species variation in pathogen susceptibility and competitive interactions of the host species with the environment, as caused by species diversity treatments, are key determinants of the occurrence and severity of fungal diseases.},

abstract = {Niche differentiation, assumed to be a key mechanism of species coexistence, requires that species differ in their functional traits. So far it remains unclear to which extent trait plasticity leads to niche shifts of species at higher plant diversity, thereby increasing or decreasing niche overlap between species. To analyse this question it is convenient to measure niches indirectly via the variation in resource-uptake traits rather than directly via the resources used. We provisionally call these indirectly measured niches trait-based niches. We studied shoot- and leaf-morphological characteristics in seven legume species in monoculture and multi-species mixture in experimental grassland. Legume species varied in the extent of trait variation in response to plant diversity. Trait plasticity led to significant shifts in species niches in multiple dimensions. Single-species niches in several traits associated with height growth and filling of canopy space were expanded, while other niche dimensions were compressed or did not change with plant diversity. Niche separation among legumes decreased in dimensions related to height growth and space filling, but increased in dimensions related to leaf size and morphology. The total extent of occupied niche space was larger in mixture than in the combined monocultures for dimensions related to leaf morphology and smaller for dimensions related to whole-plant architecture. Taller growth, greater space filling and greater plasticity in shoot height were positively, while larger values and greater plasticity in specific leaf area were negatively related with increased performance of species in mixture. Our study shows that trait variation in response to plant diversity shifts species niches along trait axes. Plastically increased niche differentiation is restricted to niche dimensions that are apparently not related to size-dependent differences between species, but functional equivalence (convergence in height growth) rather than complementarity (divergence in traits associated with light acquisition) explains increased performance of legumes in mixture.},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that the contribution of individual species to the positive relationship between species richness and community biomass production cannot be easily predicted from species monocultures. Here, we used a biodiversity experiment with a pool of nine potentially dominant grassland species to relate the species richness-productivity relationship to responses in density, size and aboveground allocation patterns of individual species. Aboveground community biomass increased strongly with the transition from monocultures to two-species mixtures but only slightly with the transition from two- to nine-species mixtures. Tripartite partitioning showed that the strong increase shown by the former was due to trait-independent complementarity effects, while the slight increase shown by the latter was due to dominance effects. Trait-dependent complementarity effects depended on species composition. Relative yield total (RYT) was greater than 1 (RYT>1) in mixtures but did not increase with species richness, which is consistent with the constant complementarity effect. The relative yield (RY) of only one species, Arrhenatherum elatius, continually increased with species richness, while those of the other species studied decreased with species richness or varied among different species compositions within richness levels. High observed/expected RYs (RYo/RYe>1) of individual species were mainly due to increased module densities, whereas low observed/expected RYs (RYo/RYe<1) were due to more pronounced decreases in module density (species with stoloniferous or creeping growth) or module size (species with clearly-defined plant individuals). The trade-off between module density and size, typical for plant populations under the law of constant final yield, was compensated among species. The positive trait-independent complementarity effect could be explained by an increase in community module density, which reached a maximum at low species richness. In contrast, the increasing dominance effect was attributable to the species-specific ability, in particular that of A. elatius, to increase module size, while intrinsic growth limitations led to a suppression of the remaining species in many mixtures.},

abstract = {In a large integrated biodiversity project (‘The Jena Experiment' in Germany) we established two experiments, one with a pool of 60 plant species that ranged broadly from dominant to subordinate competitors on large 20 × 20 m and small 3.5 × 3.5 m plots (= main experiment), and one with a pool of nine potentially dominant species on small 3.5 × 3.5 m plots (= dominance experiment). We found identical positive species richness–aboveground productivity relationships in the main experiment at both scales. This result suggests that scaling up, at least over the short term, is appropriate in interpreting the implications of such experiments for larger-scale patterns. The species richness–productivity relationship was more pronounced in the experiment with dominant species (46.7 and 82.6% yield increase compared to mean monoculture, respectively). Additionally, transgressive overyielding occurred more frequently in the dominance experiment (67.7% of cases) than in the main experiment (23.4% of cases). Additive partitioning and relative yield total analyses showed that both complementarity and selection effects contributed to the positive net biodiversity effect.},

abstract = {1. The spatial pattern of tree species retains signatures of factors and processes such as dispersal, available resource patches for establishment, competition and demographics. Comparison of the spatial pattern of different size classes can thus help to reveal the importance and characteristics of the underlying processes. However, tree dynamics may be masked by large-scale heterogeneous site conditions, e.g. when the restricting size of regeneration sites superimposes emergent patterns. \n\n2. Here we ask how environmental heterogeneity may influence the spatial dynamics of plant communities. We compared the spatial patterns and demographics of western hemlock in a homogeneous and a heterogeneous site of old-growth Douglas-fir forests on Vancouver Island using recent techniques of point pattern analysis. We used homogeneous and inhomogeneous K- and pair-correlation functions, and case-control studies to quantify the change in spatial distribution for different size classes of western hemlock. \n\n3. Our comparative analyses show that biological processes interacted with spatial heterogeneity, leading to qualitatively different population dynamics at the two sites. Population structure, survival and size structure of western hemlock were different in the heterogeneous stand in such a way that, compared to the homogeneous stand, seedlings were more clustered, seedling densities higher, seedling mortality lower, adult growth faster and adult mortality higher. Under homogeneous site conditions, seedling survival was mainly abiotically determined by random arrival in small gaps with limiting light. At the heterogeneous site, seedling densities and initial survival were much higher, leading to strong density-dependent mortality and selection for faster growing individuals in larger size classes. We hypothesise that the dynamics of the heterogeneous stand were faster due to asymmetric competition with disproportionate benefit to taller plants. \n\n4. Synthesis. Our study supports the hypothesis that successional dynamics are intensified in heterogeneous forest stands with strong spatial structures and outlines the importance of spatial heterogeneity as a determinant of plant population dynamics and pattern formation.},

abstract = {1. While positive effects of biodiversity on temporal stability of communities have been demonstrated in theoretical and empirical studies, diversitystability relationships at the population level remain poorly understood. 2. We investigated temporal variability of plant populations in experimental grassland plots of varying species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 1660 species), functional group richness and composition (presence/absence of legumes grasses small herbs tall herbs) in a long-term biodiversity experiment from 2003 to 2009 (Jena Experiment). 3. Average population stability, defined as the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation of above-ground biomass production over time, differed largely between species but was generally higher in grasses and small herbs than in legumes and tall herbs. Furthermore, population stability was positively related to a species proportional contribution to community biomass. Thus, an increasing number of subordinate species explained lower average population stabilities at higher diversity levels. 4. A negative covariance (CV) across all species-richness levels suggested negatively correlated species dynamics. Species belonging to different functional groups fluctuated asynchronously, while species dynamics within functional groups were more synchronous. Community-wide species synchrony decreased with increasing species richness, and temporal stability at the community level increased. 5. Synthesis: Our results suggest that diversitystability relationships are driven by fluctuations in the population biomass of individual species which are less synchronized in more diverse than in less diverse mixtures and monocultures. Dominant plant species tend to be more stabilized than subdominant species, independently of community species richness. However, asynchrony of population dynamics outweighs decreasing population stability with increasing species richness, resulting in higher temporal stability at the plant community level.},

abstract = {Key microalgal species are currently being exploited as biomanufacturing platforms using mass cultivation systems. The opportunities to enhance productivity levels or produce non-native compounds are increasing as genetic manipulation and metabolic engineering tools are rapidly advancing. Regardless of the end product, there are both environmental and industrial risks associated to open pond cultivation of mutant microalgal strains. A mutant escape could be detrimental to local biodiversity and increase the risk of algal blooms. Similarly, if the cultivation pond is invaded by a wild-type (WT) microalgae or the mutant reverts to WT phenotypes, productivity could be impacted. To investigate these potential risks, a response surface methodology was applied to determine the competitive outcome of two Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains, a WT (CC-124) and a high-lipid accumulating mutant (CC-4333), grown in mixotrophic conditions, with differing levels of nitrogen and initial WT to mutant ratios. Results of the growth experi- ments show that mutant cells have double the exponential growth rate of the WT in monoculture. However, due to a slower transition from lag phase to exponential phase, mutant cells are outcompeted by the WT in every co-culture treatment. This suggests that, under the conditions tested, outdoor cultivation of the C. reinhardtii cell wall-deficient mutant strains does not carry a significant environmental risk to its WT in an escape scenario. Furthermore, lipid results show the mutant strain accumulates over 200% more TAGs per cell, at 50 mg L−1 NH4Cl, compared to the WT, therefore, the fragility of the mutant strain could impact on overall industrial productivity.},

abstract = {Research on plant biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has mainly focused on terrestrial ecosystems, and our understanding of how plant species diversity and interactions affect processes in marine ecosystems is still limited. To investigate if plant species richness and composition influence plant productivity in brackish water angiosperm communities, a 14 wk field experiment was conducted. Using a replacement design with a standardized initial aboveground biomass, shoots of Zostera marina, Polamogeton filiformis and P. perfoliatus were planted on a shallow, sandy bottom in replicated monocultures and all possible species combinations. Response variables included aboveground and belowground biomass, shoot density, space Occupation and porewater nutrients. To determine whether selection and/or complementarity controlled productivity, additive partitioning and D-i were calculated. Richness effects were species-specific and only increased the biomass production of P. perfoliatus and tuber production of P. filiformis, while species composition generally had a stronger effect on biomass production. Additive partitioning indicated a positive complementarity effect for the aboveground biomass production in bicultures in general, while a positive net effect was found in the P. perfoliatus and P. filiformis biculture. Despite the absence of significant results for other treatments and plant variables, a trend of positive complementarity and negative selection effects were present. Plant diversity had no clear effect on sediment porewater nutrient concentrations, indicating weak richness effects on resource use.},

abstract = {Plant biodiversity theory suggests that increased plant species diversity contributes to the stability of ecosystems. In managed grasslands, such as pastures, greater stability of herbage production would be beneficial. In this retrospective study, I used data from three reports from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1960s to determine whether increasing mixture complexity contributed to yield stability with time. Yield data from a total of 175 mixtures of grasses and legumes (two to seven species per mixture) in experiments of 3-6 year duration in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Utah, USA, were used in the analysis. Regression was used to examine relationships among herbage yield, stability of yield [measured as the interannual coefficient of variation (CV)], and diversity measures [Shannon diversity index (H), species richness (S), and evenness (J)]. In several instances there was no relationship between herbage yield or yield stability and the complexity (number of species) of the mixture. In one experiment, the proportion of legume in the sward seemed to be the controlling factor regarding herbage yield and yield stability. Monocultures and binary mixtures frequently had the highest interannual CV (e.g., less yield stability) than more complex mixtures. Within forage mixtures, however, there was no consistent relationship between herbage yield or yield stability and measures of species diversity. Species identity and composition of forage mixtures may be more important determinants of herbage yield than simply the number of species.},

abstract = {Formulating grass-legume mixtures requires knowledge of how the proportion of species in a seed mixture (i.e., species evenness) affects productivity and weed abundance. We hypothesized that mixtures with more equal proportions of species in the seed mixture (i.e., greater species evenness) would have greater productivity and fewer weeds than mixtures dominated by one or two species or monocultures. Two experiments with 15 mixtures and monocultures of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), quackgrass (Elytrigia repens L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) (Exp. 1) or 15 mixtures and monocultures of meadow fescue [Schedonorus pratensis (Huds.) P. Beauv.], reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), red clover (T. pratense L.), and kura clover (T. ambiguum L.) (Exp. 2) were sown in autumn 2008 at four locations in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In each experiment, there were four monocultures, four mixtures dominated by one species, six mixtures dominated by pairs of species, and one equal mixture. Mixtures and monocultures were harvested four to five times each year from 2009 to 2011. Mixtures often had more biomass than the average of legume or N-fertilized grass monocultures. Mixtures with more equal proportions of species in the seed mixture, however, did not have more biomass or fewer weeds than other mixtures. Rather, differences in yield were related to the dominant species in the mixture. Optimal legume percentages (30-40%) in the harvested biomass were achieved with a wide range of grass and legume seed proportions, which suggested that farmers have wide flexibility in formulating seed mixtures for pastures.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton play an important role as primary producers and thus can affect higher trophic levels. Phytoplankton growth and diversity may, besides other factors, be controlled by seasonal temperature changes and increasing water temperatures. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of temperature and diversity on phytoplankton growth. In a controlled laboratory experiment, monocultures of 15 freshwater phytoplankton taxa (green algae, cyanobacteria, and diatoms) as well as 25 mixed communities of different species richness (2-12 species) and taxa composition were exposed to constant temperatures of 12, 18, and 24 °C. Additionally, they were exposed to short-term daily temperature peaks of +4 °C. Increased species richness had a positive effect on phytoplankton growth rates and phosphorous content at all temperature levels, with maximum values occurring at 18 °C. Overyielding was observed at almost all temperature levels and could mostly be explained by complementary traits. Higher temperatures resulted in higher fractions of cyanobacteria in communities. This negative effect of temperature on phytoplankton diversity following a shift in community composition was most obvious in communities adapted to cooler temperatures, pointing to the assumption that relative temperature changes may be more important than absolute ones.},

We tested whether plant species richness, functional group richness or the presence/absence of particular plant functional groups influences the Si and Ca concentrations (mmol g(-1)) and stocks (mmol m(-2)) in aboveground plant biomass in a large grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment). In the experiment including 60 temperate grassland species, plant diversity was manipulated as sown species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16) and richness and identity of plant functional groups (1-4; grasses, small herbs, tall herbs, legumes). We found positive species richness effects on Si as well as Ca stocks that were attributable to increased biomass production. The presence of particular functional groups was the most important factor explaining variation in aboveground Si and Ca stocks (mmol m(-2)). Grass presence increased the Si stocks by 140 % and legume presence increased the Ca stock by 230 %. Both the presence of specific plant functional groups and species diversity altered Si and Ca stocks, whereas Si and Ca concentration were affected mostly by the presence of specific plant functional groups. However, we found a negative effect of species diversity on Si and Ca accumulation, by calculating the deviation between mixtures and mixture biomass proportions, but in monoculture concentrations. These changes may in turn affect ecosystem processes such as plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in grasslands.},

Here, we used a plant-herbivore system to study the effects of selective herbivory on consumption resistance and recovery after herbivory in 81 experimental grassland plots. Communities were established from seed in 2002 and contained 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 60 plant species of 1, 2, 3 or 4 functional groups. In 2004, pairs of enclosure cages (1 m tall, 0.5 m diameter) were set up on all 81 plots. One randomly selected cage of each pair was stocked with 10 male and 10 female nymphs of the meadow grasshopper, Chorthippus parallelus. The grasshoppers fed for 2 months, and the vegetation was monitored over 1 year. Consumption resistance and recovery of vegetation were calculated as proportional changes in vegetation biomass. Overall, grasshopper herbivory averaged 6.8%. Herbivory resistance and recovery were influenced by plant functional group identity, but independent of plant species richness and number of functional groups. However, herbivory induced shifts in vegetation composition that depended on plant species richness. Grasshopper herbivory led to increases in herb cover at the expense of grasses. Herb cover increased more strongly in species-rich mixtures. We conclude that selective herbivory changes the functional composition of plant communities and that compositional changes due to selective herbivory depend on plant species richness.},

abstract = {The rate at which a plant species is attacked by invertebrate herbivores has been hypothesized to depend on plant species richness, yet empirical evidence is scarce. Current theory predicts higher herbivore damage in monocultures than in species-rich mixtures. We quantified herbivore damage by insects and molluscs to plants in experimental plots established in 2002 from a species pool of 60 species of Central European Arrhenatherum grasslands. Plots differed in plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 60 species), number of functional groups (1, 2, 3, 4), functional group and species composition. We estimated herbivore damage by insects and molluscs at the level of transplanted plant individuals ("phytometer" species Plantago lanceolata, Trifolium pratense, Rumex acetosa) and of the entire plant community during 2003 and 2004. In contrast to previous studies, our design allows specific predictions about the relative contributions of functional diversity, plant functional identity, and species richness in relation to herbivory. Additionally, the phytometer approach is new to biodiversity-herbivory studies, allowing estimates of species-specific herbivory rates within the larger biodiversity-ecosystem functioning context. Herbivory in phytometers and experimental communities tended to increase with plant species richness and the number of plant functional groups, but the effects were rarely significant. Herbivory in phytometers was in some cases positively correlated with community biomass or leaf area index. The most important factor influencing invertebrate herbivory was the presence of particular plant functional groups. Legume (grass) presence strongly increased (decreased) herbivory at the community level. The opposite pattern was found for herbivory in T. pratense phytometers. We conclude that (1) plant species richness is much less important than previously thought and (2) plant functional identity is a much better predictor of invertebrate herbivory in temperate grassland ecosystems.},

abstract = {The relationship between plant diversity and nitrate leaching into groundwater was investigated in a mid-European semi-natural grassland ecosystem. An experimental approach was used to directly manipulate plant diversity in the field, while holding other environmental factors constant. Species loss was simulated by establishing grassland communities of 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0 plant species, composed of 3, 2, or 1 functional groups (grasses, legumes, and non-legume herbs). Every diversity treatment was replicated with several different species mixtures. Nitrate leaching was determined by continuous extraction of soil solution below the rooting zone and modeling of seepage rates. The concentration of nitrate in the soil solution was highly variable within each level of diversity. In bare ground plots and several low-diversity mixtures containing legumes, nitrate concentrations were higher than the official European Union threshold value for drinking water of 50 mg/L, with maximum values of up to 350 mg/L measured in Trifolium pratense monocultures. Total annual loss of nitrate was unaffected by the number of plant species or functional groups, but it was highly dependent on the specific species composition of the communities, and plots with legumes lost significantly more nitrate than plots without them. Aboveground biomass had no influence on nitrate loss, whereas leaching was negatively correlated with increasing root biomass. The abundance of legumes within a community, litter decomposition rates, and net nitrification were all positively correlated with total nitrate loss. However, in those communities containing legumes, leaching decreased with increasing diversity, because higher species richness led to a reduction in legume dominance, to a reduced nitrate supply through nitrification, and to a complementary uptake of nitrate by grasses and non-leguminous herbs. Based on these results, we expect that increasing the diversity of non-leguminous species or functional groups would reduce the risk of nitrate leaching in low-diversity grass–clover mixtures of ley-farming systems, while allowing for a more efficient exploitation of the beneficial fertilization effect provided by legumes.

abstract = {The semiochemical diversity hypothesis (SDH) states that interference with host-selection from non-host volatiles (NHV) is an important mechanism for associational resistance. Inhibition of bark beetle attraction to point sources by non-host volatiles (NHV) is well established and might be a signal serving in host-selection also at the habitat scale. In forests dominated by Norway spruce in middle and northern Europe (N Slovakia 2006 & 2007, SE Sweden 2007), we applied a blend of NHV and verbenone, released from dispensers fixed at 2 and 6 m height at forest edges with high Ips typographus populations. In Slovakia, three different doses (0.2–0.7 dispensers/m forest edge) were tested in 20-tree zones of spruce stand edges. The Swedish experiments used only the middle dose. In Slovakia, there was high tree mortality but dispensers with the anti-attractants reduced killed trees in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction in tree killing ranged from 35 to 76% compared to untreated zones. Regression analysis of relative tree kill on log dispenser density was highly significant ( = 0.34, corresponding effect size d≈ 0.98). In Sweden, with lower beetle populations, most attacks (99%) were found outside the experimental areas, with high attack rates (15 trees/ha) in a range of 15–30 m from treated groups, indicating an active inhibitory radius exceeding the previous estimates. The SDH as a functional aspect of biodiversity was tested by converting spruce monocultures into an artificial semiochemically mixed forests. The use of NHV provides the only non-insecticidal method of direct protection of conifer forests. The demonstrated principle of protection is still too expensive for area-wide use, but viable for high-value areas (nature reserves). Further development of push–pull strategies or area-wide applications may prove more cost efficient. In the long-term, the only sustainable approach is a forest landscape of mixed habitats.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Understanding ecosystem responses to plant species loss is essential for the optimal management of grasslands. Recent studies have examined the effects of simulated random species loss in experimental plant communities but not those of realistic non-random species loss resulting from transient extinction pressures in semi-natural grasslands. 2. To investigate the potential effects of non-random species loss on grassland productivity, we established mesocosms with mixed communities comprising 15 plant species, and exposed them to 2 years of high-intensity management (an extinction phase) followed by 2 years of low-intensity management (a restoration phase) allowing recolonization from differentially managed neighbouring plots. In addition, monocultures of each component species were subject to the same extinction-restoration phases. 3. During the extinction phase, species with high monoculture biomass had lower extinction probabilities in the mixed community than species with low monoculture biomass, but there was also species-specific variation. The species that were most productive or most persistent during the extinction phase were not the same as those performing best in the restoration phase. 4. No consistent effects of spontaneous recolonization from neighbouring communities on species richness or productivity of the focal communities were observed during the restoration phase. 5. We estimated that extinction of all but the species with the lowest extinction risk reduced biomass productivity by 42-49%; loss of all but the four species with the lowest extinction risk reduced it by 2-35%. Identical calculations for a random extinction scenario yielded reductions of 52% and 26-54%, respectively. 6. Synthesis and applications. Prediction of the effects of species loss on plant production and on other aspects of ecosystem functioning in semi-natural grasslands must account for both specific non-random extinction processes and post-extinction conditions. For European mesic grasslands experiencing a shift from high-intensity to low-intensity management, our results suggest that recolonization by 'missing' species must be actively assisted if high production is a management objective.},

abstract = {Aims: The aim of this guide is to provide practical help for ecologists who analyze data from biodiversity–ecosystem functioning experiments. Our approach differs from others in the use of least squares-based linear models (LMs) together with restricted maximum likelihood- based mixed models (MMs) for the analysis of hierarchical data. An original data set containing diameter and height of young trees grown in monocultures, 2- or 4-species mixtures under ambient light or shade is used as an example. Methods: Starting with a simple LM, basic features of model fitting and the subsequent analysis of variance (ANOVA) for significance tests are summarized. From this, more complex models are developed. We use the statistical software R for model fitting and to demonstrate similarities and complementarities between LMs and MMs. The for- mation of contrasts and the use of error (LMs) or random-effects (MMs) terms to account for hierarchical data structure in ANOVAs are explained. Important Findings: Data from biodiversity experiments can be analyzed at the level of entire plant communities (plots) and plant individuals. The basic explanatory term is species composition, which can be divided into contrasts in many ways depending on specific biological hypotheses. Typically, these contrasts code for aspects of species richness or the presence of particular species. For significance tests in ANOVAs, contrast terms generally are compared with remaining variation of the explanatory terms from which they have been ‘carved out'. Once a final model has been selected, parameters (e.g. means or slopes for fixed-effects terms and variance components for error or random-effects terms) can be estimated to indicate the direction and size of effects.

abstract = {AimsThe potential for mixtures of plant species to produce more biomass than every one of their constituent species in monoculture is still controversially discussed in the literature. Here we tested how this so-called transgressive overyielding is affected by variation between and within species in monoculture yields in biodiversity experiments. MethodsWe use basic statistical principles to calculate expected maximum monoculture yield in a species pool used for a biodiversity experiment. Using a real example we show how between- and within-species variance components in monoculture yields can be obtained. Combining the two components we estimate the importance of sampling bias in transgressive overyielding analysis. Important FindingsThe net biodiversity effect (difference between mixture and average monoculture yield) needed to achieve transgressive overyielding increases with the number of species in a mixture and with the variation between constituent species in monoculture yields. If there is no significant variation between species, transgressive overyielding should not be calculated using the best monoculture, because in this case the difference between this species and the other species could exclusively reflect a sampling bias. The sampling bias decreases with increasing variation between species. Tests for transgressive overyielding require replicated species' monocultures. However, it can be doubted whether such an emphasis on monocultures in biodiversity experiments is justified if an analysis of transgressive overyielding is not the major goal.},

abstract = {Species richness has been shown to increase biomass production of plant communities. Such overyielding occurs when a community performs better than its component monocultures due to the complementarity or dominance effect and is mostly detected in substrate-bound plant communities (terrestrial plants or submerged macrophytes) where resource use complementarity can be enhanced due to differences in rooting architecture and depth. Here, we investigated whether these findings are generalizeable for free-floating phytoplankton with little potential for spatial differences in resource use. We performed aquatic microcosm experiments with eight phytoplankton species belonging to four functional groups to determine the manner in which species and community biovolume varies in relation to the number of functional groups and hypothesized that an increasing number of functional groups within a community promotes overyielding. Unexpectedly, we did not detect overyielding in any algal community. Instead, total community biovolume tended to decrease with an increasing number of functional groups. This underyielding was mainly caused by the negative dominance effect that originated from a trade-off between growth rate and final biovolume. In monoculture, slow-growing species built up higher biovolumes than fast-growing ones, whereas in mixture a fast-growing but low-productive species monopolized most of the nutrients and prevented competing species from developing high biovolumes expected from monocultures. Our results indicated that the magnitude of the community biovolume was largely determined by the identity of one species. Functional diversity and resource use complementarity were of minor importance among free-floating phytoplankton, possibly reflecting the lack of spatially heterogeneous resource distribution. As a consequence, biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships may not be easily generalizeable from substrate-bound plant to phytoplankton communities and vice versa.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of herbivory for the structure and functioning of species-rich forests, little is known about how herbivory is affected by tree species richness, and more specifically by random vs. non-random species loss. We assessed herbivore damage and its effects on tree growth in the early stage of a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China that features random and non-random extinction scenarios of tree mixtures numbering between one and 24 species. In contrast to random species loss, the non-random extinction scenarios were based on the tree species' local rarity and specific leaf area - traits that may strongly influence the way herbivory is affected by plant species richness. Herbivory increased with tree species richness across all scenarios and was unaffected by the different species compositions in the random and non-random extinction scenarios. Whereas tree growth rates were positively related to herbivory on plots with smaller trees, growth rates significantly declined with increasing herbivory on plots with larger trees. Our results suggest that the effects of herbivory on growth rates increase from monocultures to the most species-rich plant communities and that negative effects with increasing tree species richness become more pronounced with time as trees grow larger. Synthesis. Our results indicate that key trophic interactions can be quick to become established in forest plantations (i.e. already 2.5 years after tree planting). Stronger herbivory effects on tree growth with increasing tree species richness suggest a potentially important role of herbivory in regulating ecosystem functions and the structural development of species-rich forests from the very start of secondary forest succession. The lack of significant differences between the extinction scenarios, however, contrasts with findings from natural forests of higher successional age, where rarity had negative effects on herbivory. This indicates that the effects of non-random species loss could change with forest succession.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved. Interactions across trophic levels influence plant diversity effects on ecosystem functions, but the complexity of these interactions remains poorly explored. For example, the interplay between different interactions (e.g. mutualism, predation) might be an important moderator of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships. We tested for relationships between trophobioses (facultative ant-hemipteran mutualism) and leaf chewer herbivory in a subtropical forest biodiversity experiment. We analysed trophobiosis and herbivory data of more than 10 000 trees along a tree species richness gradient. Against expectations, chewing damage was higher on trees with trophobioses. However, the net positive relationship between trophobioses and overall herbivory depended on tree species richness, being most pronounced at low richness. Our results point to indirect, positive effects of ant-tended sap suckers on leaf chewers, potentially by altering plant defences. Direct antagonistic relationships of trophobiotic ants and leaf-chewing herbivores-frequently reported to drive community-wide effects of trophobioses in other ecosystems- seemed less relevant. However, antagonistic interactions likely contributed to the attenuating effect of tree species richness, because trophobiotic ant and herbivore communities changed from monocultures to species-rich mixtures. Our findings, therefore, suggest that biodiversity loss might lead to complex changes in higher trophic level effects on ecosystem functions, mediated by both trophic and non-trophic interactions.},

abstract = {Stand diversification increasingly emerges as a promising means for improving the multi-functionality and sustainability of management in plantation forests. Increasing tree species richness might potentially also benefit natural enemies, which can substantially contribute to sustainable forest management via top-down control of forest pests. However, there is little empirical evidence on how tree species richness affects the diversity and abundance of predators, as the majority of analyses to date have rarely gone beyond comparisons of monocultures and two species mixtures. Here, we analyzed the performance of spiders as important generalist predators in a tree diversity experiment that uses four of the economically most important broadleaved and coniferous tree species in Europe. We tested the extent to which tree species richness and the identity of the planted tree species affect the abundance, biomass, species richness and functional diversity of spiders. Whereas tree species richness in general had no significant effect, tree species identity strongly affected spider biomass and abundance-with a particularly strong negative effect of the non-native Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Our results indicate that increasing tree species richness does not necessarily promote characteristics of natural enemy assemblages relevant for pest control in forests and thus not all functions that may be important in a multi-functional management context. Rather, tree species composition and identity will often be of crucial importance in determining forest ecosystem functions and services. The fact that the severe impact of Douglas fir persisted even in diversified tree species mixtures suggests that stand-level predator efficiency can be reduced for tree species growing adjacent to or in mixture with this species. This calls for a more thorough examination of the ecological consequences of the increasing use of this species in forestry across Europe, in particular considering that climate change may increase the potential of pest outbreaks and thus the need for adequate control in the next decades. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Context Converting monocultures to mixed-species stands is thought to be a promising approach to increase forest productivity and resilience, while additionally providing other ecosystem goods and services (EGS). However, the importance of tree species composition and structure remains unclear, particularly beyond the stand scale due to the difficulty of conducting comprehensive, long-term experiments.ObjectivesTo compare the ability of different tree species mixtures to provide various EGS at the landscape scale.MethodsWe used a dynamic forest landscape model to simulate all possible combinations of dominant tree species for two landscapes; a high-elevation alpine region (Dischma valley, Switzerland) and a lowland valley (Mt. Feldberg, Germany). We evaluated multiple EGS, including protection from gravitational hazards, aboveground biomass, and habitat quality, and examined trade-offs and synergies between them.ResultsMixed-species forests were usually better in providing multiple EGS, although monocultures were often best for single EGS. The simulation results also demonstrated how changing environmental conditions along an elevational gradient had a strong impact on the structure of different species combinations and therefore on the provisioning of EGS.ConclusionTree species diversity alone is not a good predictor of multifunctionality. Mixtures should be selected based on local environmental conditions, complementary functional traits, and the ability to provide the EGS of interest. Although our work focused on current climatic conditions, we discuss how the modelling framework could be employed to consider the impacts of climate change and disturbances to improve our understanding of how mixed-species stands could be used to cope with these challenges.},

abstract = {Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments have demonstrated that plant biomass of species grown in mixtures is often greater than plant biomass of monocultures (i.e., mixtures over yield). While we understand that plant species utilize resources differently, how a combination of species increases resource use and productivity is not well known, especially in wetland ecosystems. Here, we used a mesocosm experiment to explore diversity effects on plant biomass production and to examine the role of N partitioning as a mechanism for overyielding in wetland ecosystems. Plant functional groups (FGs) represented the unit of diversity, and we included five levels of diversity (0-4 FGs). To test for N partitioning, we used a stable isotope technique to determine niche breadth and proportion similarity of inorganic N use (NO3-and NH4+) for individual FGs as well as mixtures containing 3 and 4 FGs. We found that total plant biomass increased in the first season from an average of 290±60SEgash-freedry mass(AFDM)m-2at the 1 FG level to 490±70gAFDMm-2at the 4 FG level and in the second season from an average of 560±80gAFDMm-2at the 1 FG level to 1000±90gAFDMm-2at the 4 FG level indicating overyielding. Plant species comprising the majority of mesocosm biomass demonstrated preferential uptake of15NO3-, while species with relatively less biomass (e.g., Acorus calamus and Carex crinita) preferred15NH4+. Concentrations of15N in biomass increased with FG richness, but only in the15NO3-treatment. Niche breadth did not vary among levels of FG richness. We observed a greater niche overlap with an increase of FGs, with species taking up greater proportion of15NO3-than15NH4+. Our results indicate that plant overyielding in wetland mesocosms is not the result of niche partitioning of N chemical forms, but is associated with greater uptake of NO3. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

Many litter mixtures decompose in a non-additive manner, in which the mixture decomposes more quickly (synergistic eff ect) or more slowly (antagonistic eff ect) than would be expected based on decomposition of the component species ' litters in isolation. We investigated the potential for non-additive eff ects of invasive species ' litter by conducting a one-year litter bag experiment in which we mixed the litters of four native tree species with each of four invasive species. Litter mixtures frequently lost mass at non-additive rates, although not at every loading ratio, and the presence, sign, and strength of eff ects depended on species composition. Non-additive eff ects on N loss occurred in more litter combinations, and were almost always antagonistic at 90 days and synergistic at 365 days. Invasive species litter with lower C:N led to more strongly synergistic N loss with time. During the growing season, non-additive patterns of N loss almost always resulted in increased N release – up to six times greater than would be expected based on single-species decomposition. Consequently, we suggest that invasive species may further synchronize N release from the litter layer with plant N demand, enhancing any positive litter feedback to invasion. Th ese results highlight the need to consider non-additive eff ects of litter mixing in invaded forest communities, and suggest that estimates of invasive species ' impacts on ecosystem processes would be improved by considering these effects.},

abstract = {The persistence of species under changed climatic conditions depends on adaptations and plastic responses to these conditions and on interactions with their local plant community resulting in direct and indirect effects of changed climatic conditions. Populations at species' range margins may be especially crucial in containing a gene pool comprising adaptations to extreme climatic conditions. Many species of northern European bog ecosystems reach their southern lowland range limit in central Europe. In a common-garden experiment, we experimentally assessed the impact of projected climatic changes on five bog-plant species (including peat moss Sphagnum magellanicum) sampled along a latitudinal gradient of 1400km from Scandinavia to the marginal lowland populations in Germany. Populations were cultivated in monocultures and in experimental communities composed of all five species from their local community, and exposed to five combinations of three climate treatments (warming, fluctuating water-tables, fertilization) in a southern common garden. Whereas most monocultures showed a decreasing biomass production from southern to northern origins under southern environmental conditions, in the experimental mixed-species communities, an increasing biomass production towards northern communities was observed together with a shift in interspecific interactions along the latitudinal gradient. While negative dominance effects prevailed in southern communities, higher net biodiversity effects were observed in northern subarctic communities. The combined effects of climate treatments increased biomass production in monocultures of most origins. In communities, however, overall the treatments did not result in significantly changed biomass production. Among individual treatments, water-table fluctuations caused a significant decrease in biomass production, but only in southern communities, indicating higher vulnerability to changed climatic conditions. Here, negative effects of climate treatments on graminoids were not compensated by the slightly increased growth of peat moss that benefited from interspecific interactions only in northern communities.Synthesis. We conclude that shifting interactions within multispecies communities caused pronounced responses to changed climatic conditions in wetland communities of temperate southern marginal, but not of northern subarctic origin. Therefore, future models investigating the impacts of climate change on plant communities should consider geographical variation in species interactions an important factor influencing community responses to changed climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Sphagnum magellanicum Brid. is a worldwide distributed peat moss and an ecosystem-engineer in temperate and boreal bog ecosystems suggesting a great adaptive potential to different environmental conditions. Phenotypes of S. magellanicum have been described as one species so far, although this has been questioned by the detection of several genetic groups in a recent global study. Concordant with morphological uniformity, our analyses of Mid- to Northern European plants revealed only minimal variation in nuclear nrITS and plastid rps4 sequences. However, we detected two distinct genetic groups within Europe by analyzing microsatellite data of 298 individuals from 27 populations. Plants formed an Eastern and a Western European cluster, with overlapping areas in northern Germany and southern Sweden where plants of both clusters coexist within populations but show no signs of admixture. These two cryptic taxa seem therefore to be reproductively isolated. Bayesian analyses indicated that reproductive isolation occurred before the end of the late Pleistocene glaciations. After the meltdown of the glaciers, both clusters colonized northern and central Europe from glacial refugia in the West and possibly from Euro-Siberian populations. To test for divergent adaptation to environmental conditions, we exposed plants of both clusters to experimental climate warming treatments at two different plant-diversity levels (monocultures vs. mixtures) for two years. Despite their different evolutionary history, plants of both genetic clusters responded equally to climate treatments in our southern common garden near Potsdam, Germany. However, only eastern cluster populations benefited from plant-community diversity and increased their biomass in mixtures. These differences in their ecological niche match the diverging microhabitat preferences observed in situ and may effectively hamper genetic exchange if distances between microhabitats are too large for Sphagnum sperm movement.},

Thewater uptake depth of five specieswas investigated across seasons and diversity levels using the natural abundance of water isotopes ($\delta$2H, $\delta$18O) and modelling. Three distinctwater acquisition strategieswere found for trees growing inmonocultures during the dry season: strong reliance (>70%)on soilwater fromthe upper layer (0–30cm) (Cedrela odorata), uptake from the upper and deeper layers (>30cm) in equal proportions (Hura crepitans, Anacardium excelsum and Luehea seemannii)and water uptake predominately fromdeeper layers (Tabebuia rosea). Seasonal shifts inwater uptakeweremost pronounced for T. rosea. The water uptake pattern of a given species was independent of the diversity level underlining the importance of species identity and species characteristics in spatial and temporal tree water use. Statistics did not show a significant effect of diversity on source water fractions, but we did see some evidence for complementary water resource utilization in mixed species plots, especially in the dry season. Our results also demonstrated that the depth of soil water uptake was related to leaf phenology and tree transpiration rates. A higher proportion of water obtained from deeper soil layers was associated with a high percentage foliage cover in the dry season, which explained the higher transpiration rates.},

abstract = {? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Although the protective role of leaf litter cover against soil erosion is known for a long time, little research has been conducted on the processes involved. Moreover, the impact of soil meso- and macrofauna within the litter layer on erosion control is not clear. To investigate how leaf litter cover and diversity as well as meso- and macrofauna influence sediment discharge in subtropical forest ecosystems, a field experiment has been carried out in Southeast China. A full-factorial random design with 96 micro-scale runoff plots and 7 domestic leaf species was established and erosion was triggered by a rainfall simulator. Our results demonstrate that leaf litter cover protects soil from erosion (-82% sediment discharge on leaf covered plots) by rainfall and this protection is removed as litter decomposes. The protective effect is influenced by the presence or absence of soil meso- and macrofauna. Fauna presence increases soil erosion rates significantly by 58 %, while leaf species diversity shows a non-significant negative trend. We assume that the faunal effect arises from arthropods slackening and processing the soil surface as well as fragmenting and decomposing the protecting leaf litter covers. Even though the diversity level did not show a significant influence, single leaf species in monocultures show rather different impacts on sediment discharge and thus, erosion control. In our experiment, runoff plots with leaf litter from Machilus thunbergii showed the highest sediment discharge (68.0gm-2) whereas plots with Cyclobalanopsis glauca showed the smallest rates (7.9gm-2).},

abstract = {Mixing different tree species in forest plantations might increase stand productivity and resilience compared to monocultures, but mixing effects in the early stage of mixed forest plantations are still poorly understood. In general, sapling growth is affected by environmental factors, sapling species identity, direct and indirect interactions with neighbouring saplings, and competition with the ground layer vegetation. We assessed the diameter increment, height increment, and height to diameter ratio of ca. 5500 permanently marked saplings growing in local neighbourhoods that differ in number and identity of the sapling species present. We found that sapling growth was related to the sapling's species identity and the characteristics of its local neighbourhood (notably phylogenetic diversity, relative size asymmetry, and ground vegetation cover). The identity of the neighbours only mattered when target and neighbour tree species differed in, for instance, light requirements. The growth of the young saplings was positively affected by tall neighbours and ground vegetation cover. This suggests that careful species selection when designing mixed forest plantations is important and that ground vegetation can be favourable for sapling growth in the first years of a new plantation.},

abstract = {The objective was to analyse how differences in the initial proportions of tree species and site fertility affect carbon sequestration in living biomass and soil. We used the individual-based simulation model EFIMOD, which is able to simulate spatially explicit competition between trees for light and nutrients. Simulations were carried out for three site types with distinct initial stocks of soil nutrients. For each site, the 100-years undisturbed dynamics of monocultures and mixtures of three tree species (Betula pendula Roth, Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) was predicted. Changes in the proportions of competing tree species were dependent on the fertility of the site: on poor sites, pine was the most competent species, while on rich sites, spruce increased its proportion during stand succession. Net primary production (NPP) and soil respiration were the highest in stands of two coniferous species and in stands with a high initial proportion of pine. Mixed stands were more productive than monocultures; the highest overyielding was observed with mixtures of two coniferous species. Simulated NPP and carbon stocks in all pools increased from poor to rich sites. The highest carbon stocks in standing biomass were observed for mixtures of conifer species and three-species mixtures; the greatest accumulation of forest floor occurred in stands with high proportions of pine. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

Dewey], and crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum {L.} Gaertn., var. Hycrest]) increase as desired species richness within seeding mixture increases, and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam.) decrease as desirable species richness increases. We simultaneously tested the degree of niche differentiation among desired species. Experiments consisted of 7 seeding monocultures and combinations. Treatments were monocultures of each desired species (3 plots), all combinations of 2 desirable species (2 250 seeds{\textperiodcentered}m-2per species; 3 plots), and 1 plot containing all 3 desirable species (1 500 seeds{\textperiodcentered}m-2per species). Monocultures or mixtures were replicated 4 times by seeding each treatment with four background densities of spotted knapweed (1 250, 2 500, 3 750, and 7 500 seeds{\textperiodcentered}m-2; 7 treatments x 4 background densities = 28 plots). Analysis included regression with the 7 desired species monocultures or mixtures as a fixed effect and spotted knapweed sowing density as a continuous effect. All desired species established had either low or no negative influence on their neighbor, and differed in niche after 7 years of growing in association. Increasing richness of desired species led to increased productivity. Spotted knapweed density and biomass were low across all monocultures and mixtures at the productive site because shade and litter of desired species reduced light availability to the rosette-forming invasive weed. Combining crested wheatgrass and alfalfa provided lower spotted knapweed density and biomass more than did monocultures or grass mixtures because these 2 species appeared to occupy complementary niches. Increased niche occupation by nonnative desirable species may increase resource use and productivity, thus minimizing establishment and dominance of unwanted invasive plants during rehabilitation on arid, marginally productive rangeland sites.},

In contrast, the species richness of pest insects significantly affected their natural enemies. These findings suggest a cascade effect where trophic interactions are strong between adjacent trophic levels, while the interactions between connected but nonadjacent trophic levels are weakened by the intermediate trophic level.

abstract = {Numerous experiments, mostly performed in particular environments, have shown positive diversity-productivity relationships. Although the complementary use of resources is discussed as an important mechanism explaining diversity effects, less is known about how resource availability controls the strength of diversity effects and how this response depends on the functional composition of plant communities. We studied aboveground biomass production in experimental monocultures, two- and four-species mixtures assembled from two independent pools of four perennial grassland species, each representing two functional groups (grasses, forbs) and two growth statures (small, tall), and exposed to different combinations of light and nutrient availability. On average, shade led to a decrease in aboveground biomass production of 24% while fertilization increased biomass production by 36%. Mixtures were on average more productive than expected from their monocultures (relative yield total, RYT>1) and showed positive net diversity effects (NE: +34% biomass increase; mixture minus mean monoculture biomass). Both trait-independent complementarity effects (TICE: +21%) and dominance effects (DE: +12%) positively contributed to net diversity effects, while trait-dependent complementarity effects were minor (TDCE: +1%). Shading did not alter diversity effects and overyielding. Fertilization decreased RYT and the proportion of biomass gain through TICE and TDCE, while DE increased. Diversity effects did not increase with species richness and were independent of functional group or growth stature composition. Trait-based analyses showed that the dominance of species with root and leaf traits related to resource conservation increased TICE. Traits indicating the tolerance of shade showed positive relationships with TDCE. Large DE were associated with the dominance of species with tall growth and low diversity in leaf nitrogen concentrations. Our field experiment shows that positive diversity effects are possible in grass-forb mixtures irrespective of differences in light availability, but that the chance for the complementary use of resources increases when nutrients are not available at excess.},

Here we experimentally tested the effects of genotypic diversity on ecologically relevant cellular parameters (growth, primary production, particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, particulate organic phosphorus and biogenic silica) at optimal and suboptimal salinity conditions in a marine phytoplankton species. Multiple clonal genotyped and phenotypically characterized isolates of the diatom Skeletonema marinoi from the Baltic Sea were grown in monocultures and mixes of 5 and 20 clones at native (5 psu) and reduced (3 psu) salinities and respective parameters were compared. Re-genotyping of 30 individuals from each population at five microsatellite loci at the end of the experiment confirmed maintenance of genotypic richness. Although a diversity effect on growth was not detected, primary production and particulate organic nutrients were positively affected by increased diversity independent of salinity condition. Under salinity stress, highest values of primary production and particulate organic nitrogen content were measured at the high diversity level. The observed diversity effects emphasize the importance of genetic diversity of phytoplankton populations for ecological functions.},

abstract = {Cover crops provide a variety of important agroecological services within cropping systems. Typically these crops are grown as monocultures or simple graminoid-legume bicultures; however, ecological theory and empirical evidence suggest that agroecosystem services could be enhanced by growing cover crops in species-rich mixtures. We examined cover crop productivity, weed suppression, stability, and carryover effects to a subsequent cash crop in an experiment involving a five-species annual cover crop mixture and the component species grown as monocultures in SE New Hampshire, USA in 2011 and 2012. The mean land equivalent ratio (LER) for the mixture exceeded 1.0 in both years, indicating that the mixture over-yielded relative to the monocultures. Despite the apparent over-yielding in the mixture, we observed no enhancement in weed suppression, biomass stability, or productivity of a subsequent oat (Avena sativa L.) cash crop when compared to the best monoculture component crop. These data are some of the first to include application of the LER to an analysis of a cover crop mixture and contribute to the growing literature on the agroecological effects of cover crop diversity in cropping systems.},

abstract = {1. Increasing cropping system diversity is one strategy for reducing reliance on external chemical inputs in agriculture and may have important implications for agro-ecosystem functions related to the regulation of weed populations and community assembly. However, the impacts of cropping system diversity on weed communities have not been evaluated formally in a study comparable with those performed in experimental grasslands, where much of the evidence regarding diversity-ecosystem function has been reported. We performed a field experiment in Michigan, USA, in which we manipulated the number of crop species grown in rotation and as winter cover crops over a 3-year period and in the absence of fertilizer and pesticides, to determine the impact of crop diversity on the abundance, composition and structure of the weed community. 2. Crop diversity treatments consisted of three row-crops, corn Zea mays L., soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr. and winter wheat Triticum aestivum L., grown in continuous monoculture and in 2- and 3-year annual rotations with and without cover crops (zero, one or two legume/small grain species). Weed communities were measured each year at peak biomass, with soil resources and light availability being measured over the course of the growing season in the final year of the study. 3. The effects on weed communities of the crop diversity treatments were dependent on rotation phase. In winter wheat, weed abundance and diversity (species richness, H' and D) were lowest in the two highest crop diversity treatments. Across all phases of the rotation, weed community structure was affected more by crop identity than crop diversity per se. 4. In general, the effects of crop diversity on weed communities were mainly the result of the presence of cover crops, which had strong effects on soil resource and light levels, particularly in winter wheat. 5. Synthesis and applications. Increasing crop diversity in the absence of external chemical inputs can result in changes in soil resource availability without a concomitant increase in the abundance of weeds or a shift to weed communities that are more difficult to manage.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of diversity in the functioning of ecosystems has important implications for agriculture. Previous agricultural research has shown that crop rotation and the use of cover crops can lead to increases in yield relative to monoculture; however, few studies have been performed within the broader context of diversity–ecosystem function theory and in the absence of chemical inputs. We performed a field experiment in SW Michigan, USA, in which we manipulated the number of crop species grown in rotation and as winter cover crops over a 3-year period to test if varying the number of species in a rotation affected grain yield, a critical metric of ecosystem function in row-crops. The experimental design was unique in that no fertilizer or pesticides were used, and the only management variable manipulated was number of species in the rotation, thus providing a strong comparison to grassland diversity–ecosystem function experiments. Treatments included continuous monocultures of three row-crops, corn Zea mays L., soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr., and winter wheat Triticum aestivum L., and 2- and 3-year annual rotations with and without cover crops (zero, one, or two legume/small grain species), encompassing a range of crop diversity from one to six species. Crop yields and weed biomass were measured annually for 3 years and plant available soil nitrogen was measured over the course of the growing season in the final year of the study. In all 3 years, corn grain yield increased linearly in response to the number of crops in the rotation. Corn yields in the highest diversity treatment (three crops, plus three cover crops) were over 100% higher than in continuous monoculture and were not significantly different from the county average for each of the 3 years despite the absence of chemical inputs. Corn yields in the diversity treatments were strongly correlated with the availability of inorganic soil nitrogen, which was likely influenced by the number of different legume species (crops and cover crops) present in the rotation. In soybean and winter wheat, yield differences among crop diversity treatments were also significant, but of lower magnitude (32 and 53%, respectively), and showed little direct relationship to the number of crop species grown in a rotation. Results demonstrate that agricultural research motivated by ecological theory can provide important insights into the functioning of agroecosystems and enhance our understating of the linkages between diversity and ecosystem function. Importantly, these results suggest that reduced chemical inputs do not necessarily result in yield penalties and provide support for incorporation of crop or species diversity when determining how ecosystem services can be included in food, fiber, and biofuel production.},

abstract = {The Asian green revolution trebled grain yields through agro-chemical intensification of monocultures. Associated environmental costs have subsequently emerged. A rapidly changing world necessitates sustainability principles be developed to reinvent these technologies and test them at scale. The need is particularly urgent in Africa, where ecosystems are degrading and crop yields have stagnated. An unprecedented opportunity to reverse this trend is unfolding in Malawi, where a 90% subsidy has ensured access to fertilization and improved maize seed, with substantive gains in productivity for millions of farmers. To test if economic and ecological sustainability could be improved, we preformed manipulative experimentation with crop diversity in a countrywide trial (n = 991) and at adaptive, local scales through a decade of participatory research (n = 146). Spatial and temporal treatments compared monoculture maize with legume-diversified maize that included annual and semiperennial (SP) growth habits in temporal and spatial combinations, including rotation, SP rotation, intercrop, and SP intercrop systems. Modest fertilizer intensification doubled grain yield compared with monoculture maize. Biodiversity improved ecosystem function further: SP rotation systems at half-fertilizer rates produced equivalent quantities of grain, on a more stable basis (yield variability reduced from 22% to 13%) compared with monoculture. Across sites, profitability and farmer preference matched: SP rotations provided twofold superior returns, whereas diversification of maize with annual legumes provided more modest returns. In this study, we provide evidence that in Africa, crop diversification can be effective at a countrywide scale, and that shrubby, grain legumes can enhance environmental and food security.},

abstract = {A positive role for biodiversity is assumed for managed ecosystems. We conducted a 12-year study of this sustainability principle, through separate manipulation of management intensity and crop diversity. The site was located in southwest Michigan, representative of rain-fed production, with high climate variability and well-drained soils. Provisioning services of grain and protein yield were monitored, simultaneous with supporting services of soil fertility, C and N, and regulating services associated with water quality (N-use efficiency and nitrate-N leached in gravimetric lysimeters). Surprisingly, a strong role for management was shown, and almost nil for crop diversity. Organic management (ORG) sustained soil fertility, augmented soil C (36% increase), enhanced N retention (50% decrease in nitrate-N leaching) and improved N-use efficiency, compared to conventional, integrated (INT) management. Provisioning of grain - quantity, quality and temporal yield stability - was highest in INT continuous maize (monoculture and biculture) with an annual yield of 6.4Mgha-1, compared to ORG of 5.1Mgha-1. Biodiverse rotational systems (three and six species) produced 25% lower yield, but the grain was of high quality. A focus on ORG management rather than crop diversity is suggested as a means to sequester C, and produced grain in a semi-closed system. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

The plants were grown at two sowing densities in monocultures and all possible species combinations. Our aim was to separate the selection effect from other diversity effects. This distinction is based on the notion that true overyielding is not a consequence of the selection effect. We suggest a hierarchical procedure, which is based on a repeated division of samples into the pots with the most productive species present and missing. Overyielding can be then demonstrated by a positive dependence of productivity on species richness in the subsets with the most productive species present. Although we found a strong dependence of biomass on species richness in the entire data set, the hierarchical method revealed no evidence of overyielding. Above-ground biomass in a monoculture was a good predictor of species success in a species mix.},

Diversity effects on canopy structure and the use of space and light were invest-igated in experimental grassland communities of one, two, four, eight or 32 species and of one, two or three functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-leguminous forbs) in north-western Switzerland. 2. Plant species and functional group richness improved the establishment of grass-land assemblages and increased mean vegetation cover from 64% in monocultures to 100% in 32-species mixtures. 3. Above-ground biomass and leaf area index increased linearly with the logarithm of plant species number in all 3 years of the experiment. The most species-rich com-munities produced 143% more biomass than the mean of all monocultures and 25% more biomass than the most productive monoculture in the third year of the experiment. 4. Plant light absorbance per unit ground area increased by 44% with diversity (32-species mixtures compared with monocultures) for two reasons. (i) The lack of species complementarity in terms of success of seedling establishment and plant size in vegeta-tion with low species diversity increased the gap area in the canopy, and consequently more light reached bare ground. (ii) Diverse ecosystems absorbed more light within their closed canopies (+20%) than did less diverse ecosystems, because of better three-dimensional space filling and greater biomass density due to complementarity in plant architecture, particularly between grasses and dicots. 5. The overall canopy height was increased by 46% and the centre of gravity of the canopy was raised by up to 10 cm over the range of experimental diversity treatments from one to 32 species. 6. These results cannot be explained solely by a higher likelihood of the inclusion of more productive dominant species in the more diverse communities (sampling effect), which suggests that biomass production may be determined by the most productive species present in a community. For all important canopy characteristics of multi-species communities, we show that with increasing diversity, mixtures perform better than the best monoculture. This is a strong indication that part of the positive effect of diversity on biomass production is driven by complementary resource use.},

abstract = {The loss of plant species from terrestrial ecosystems may cause changes in soil decomposer communities and in decomposition of organic material with potential further consequences for other ecosystem processes. This was tested in experimental communities of 1, 2, 4, 8, 32 plant species and of 1, 2 or 3 functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-leguminous forbs). As plant species richness was reduced from the highest species richness to monocultures, mean aboveground plant biomass decreased by 150%, but microbial biomass (measured by substrate induced respiration) decreased by only 15% (P = 0.05). Irrespective of plant species richness, the absence of legumes (across diversity levels) caused microbial biomass to decrease by 15% (P = 0.02). No effect of plant species richness or composition was detected on the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and no plant species richness effect was found on feeding activity of the mesofauna (assessed with a bait-lamina-test). Decomposition of cellulose and birchwood sticks was also not affected by plant species richness, but when legumes were absent, cellulose samples were decomposed more slowly (16% in 1996, 27% in 1997, P = 0.006). A significant decrease in earthworm population density of 63% and in total earthworm biomass by 84% was the single most prominent response to the reduction of plant species richness, largely due to a 50% reduction in biomass of the dominant 'anecic' earthworms. Voles (Arvicola terrestris L.) also had a clear preference for high-diversity plots. Soil moisture during the growing season was unaffected by plant species richness or the number of functional groups present. In contrast, soil temperature was 2 K higher in monocultures compared with the most diverse mixtures on a bright day at peak season. We conclude that the lower abundance and activity of decomposers with reduced plant species richness was related to altered substrate quantity, a signal which is not reflected in rates of decomposition of standard test material. The presence of nitrogen fixers seemed to be the most important component of the plant diversity manipulation for soil heterotrophs. The reduction in plant biomass due to the simulated loss of plant species had more pronounced effects on voles and earthworms than on microbes, suggesting that higher trophic levels are more strongly affected than lower trophic levels.},

abstract = {Plant diversity has been shown to influence the water cycle of forest ecosystems by differences in water consumption and the associated effects on groundwater recharge. However, the effects of biodiversity on soil water fluxes remain poorly understood for native tree species plantations in the tropics. Therefore, we estimated soil water fluxes and assessed the effects of tree species and diversity on these fluxes in an experimental native tree species plantation in Sardinilla (Panama). The study was conducted during the wet season 2008 on plots of monocultures and mixtures of three or six tree species. Rainfall and soil water content were measured and evapotranspiration was estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation. Soil water fluxes were estimated using a simple soil water budget model considering water input, output, and soil water and groundwater storage changes and in addition, were simulated using the physically based one-dimensional water flow model Hydrus-1D. In general, the Hydrus simulation did not reflect the observed pressure heads, in that modeled pressure heads were higher compared to measured ones. On the other hand, the results of the water balance equation (WBE) reproduced observed water use patterns well. In monocultures, the downward fluxes through the 200cm-depth plane were highest below Hura crepitans (6.13mmday-1) and lowest below Luehea seemannii (5.18mmday-1). The average seepage rate in monocultures (±SE) was 5.66±0.18mmday-1, and therefore, significantly higher than below six-species mixtures (5.49±0.04mmday-1) according to overyielding analyses. The three-species mixtures had an average seepage rate of 5.63±0.12mmday-1 and their values did not differ significantly from the average values of the corresponding species in monocultures. Seepage rates were driven by the transpiration of the varying biomass among the plots (r=0.61, p=0.017). Thus, a mixture of trees with different growth rates resulted in moderate seepage rates compared to monocultures of either fast growing or slow growing tree species. Our results demonstrate that tree-species specific biomass production and tree diversity are important controls of seepage rates in the Sardinilla plantation during the wet season. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Generalizations regarding the mechanisms underlying the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem processes, and whether the patterns transcend study systems remain elusive. Many terrestrial plant diversity manipulations have found that plant biomass increases with diversity, but most marine studies find little or no effect of seaweed diversity on producer biomass or production. However, differences in experimental approach (field vs. mesocosm) and duration (years vs. weeks) between published terrestrial and marine experiments confound the interpretation of these differences in response to changing diversity. We conducted a three-year field manipulation of seaweed diversity on intertidal rocky reefs in central California, USA, to examine the effect of diversity on seaweed cover. We found that diversity increased standing algal cover and decreased the availability of free space relative to monocultures, but this effect took nine months to materialize. Furthermore, diverse assemblages did not consistently exceed the best performing monocultures until 18 months after the experiment was initiated, suggesting that the effect of diversity strengthens over time. Overall, diversity's effect was consistently stronger than that of individual species and not attributable to the influence of any particular species (sampling effect) because (1) polycultures\r\neventually achieved higher cover than even the best performing monoculture and (2) monocultures rarely differed much, precluding a strong sampling effect. Instead, mechanisms such as facilitation and differential use of microhabitats in a heterogeneous environment likely caused the higher cover in polycultures. Our findings contrast with short-term experiments with other seaweeds but are similar to longer-term experiments with terrestrial plants, suggesting that experimental design and approach, rather than inherent differences between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, underlie contrasting responses among systems. We argue that experiments conducted in the field, and for a greater length of time, allow for the manifestation of a greater number of potential mechanisms of overyielding in diverse communities, increasing the likelihood of observing a strong diversity effect.},

abstract = {The ecological and environmental shortcomings of landscapes dominated by monocultures of crops have led to increased pressure to farm in a more holistic, environmentally sound, socially acceptable manner. The USDA Continuous Conservation Reserve Program (CCRP) is one answer to this shift in philosophy. One program within CCRP, CP33, habitat buffers for upland birds, was designed to provide incentives for substituting herbaceous buffers for crop field margins to promote wildlife habitat. Farmers have been slow to sign up for CP33, possibly out of concern for the borders' impact on insect pest abundance, crop yield and profitability. We examined the impact of three herbaceous border compositions on yield in soybean over 3 years. The border treatments were: (1) a cool-season grass/legume mixture, (2) a warm-season grass/legume mixture, and (3) tall fescue. In addition, the experimental control (soybean border) provided the opportunity to examine the effect of hedgerows on crop yield. We found only a few differences in soybean yield among border treatments and discerned no specific cause-and-effect relationship between buffers and soybean yield, or among distances into the soybean fields from the crop-border interface. We conclude that herbaceous conservation buffers would have little or no impact on soybean yield and should be promoted for their positive environmental benefits. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Although the distribution of plant species abundance in a Minnesota grassland was consistent with neutral theory, niche but not neutral mechanisms were supported by the ability of species traits to predict species abundances in three experimental grassland communities. In particular, data from 27 species grown in monoculture showed that species differed in a trait, R*, which is the level to which each species reduced the concentration of soil nitrate, the limiting soil nutrient and which is predicted to be inversely associated with competitive ability for nitrogen (N). In these N-limited habitats, species abundance ranks correlated with their predicted competitive ranks: low R* species, on average dominated. These correlations were significantly different than expected for neutral theory, which assumes the exchangeability of species traits. Additionally, we found that changes in relative abundance after environmental change (N-addition or disturbance) were not neutral but also were significantly associated with R*.},

abstract = {For two decades, genetic engineering has made it possible to develop crops and trees designed for yield improvement and simplified culture management. This, combined with field deployment of monocultures over large areas, can result in environmental stress and unwanted potential side effects. The commercial production of genetically modified (GM) crops and the recent development of GM trees raise concerns about their potential impact on the environment, in general, and on the biodiversity of non-target organisms, in particular. Fungi are spread worldwide and play key roles in ecosystems. They have been closely associated with plants since they emerged from the oceans. This review critically examines research monitoring the potential effects of GM crops and GM trees on target and non-target fungi. Parsing public databases for peer-reviewed publications about GM plant impacts on fungi yielded 149 studies, a relatively modest number considering the diversity of crops and ecosystems studied. Analysis of these publications showed that the effects of GM plants expressing herbicide and insect tolerance on fungi are understudied while they dominate the GM area worldwide. Experiments monitoring the impact of GM crops and GM trees with enhanced antifungal activity towards target fungi showed, for the most part, significant decreases in disease severity caused by fungal pathogens. Significant changes, expressed as an increase or decrease in fungal development, abundance, and diversity of non-target fungi, were observed in 18 out of 60 studies and all of them involved GM plants expressing traits that were unexpected to affect fungi. The remaining 42 studies did not identify a significant impact on fungal populations. Therefore, in spite of the fact that GM plants have been commercialized since 1996, no clear generalized trend can be identified and it appears that a case-by-case approach is the safest.},

abstract = {Higher plant diversity is often associated with higher soil microbial biomass and diversity, which is assumed to be partly due to elevated root exudate diversity. However, there is little experimental evidence that diversity of root exudates shapes soil microbial communities. We tested whether higher root exudate diversity enhances soil microbial biomass and diversity in a plant diversity gradient, thereby negating significant plant diversity effects on soil microbial properties. We set up plant monocultures and two- and three-species mixtures in microcosms using functionally dissimilar plants and soil of a grassland biodiversity experiment in Germany. Artificial exudate cocktails were added by combining the most common sugars, organic acids, and amino acids found in root exudates. We applied four different exudate cocktails: two exudate diversity levels (low- and high-diversity) and two nutrient-enriched levels (carbon- and nitrogen-enriched), and a control with water only. Soil microorganisms were more carbon- than nitrogen-limited. Cultivation-independent fingerprinting analysis revealed significantly different soil microbial communities among exudate diversity treatments. Most notably and according to our hypothesis, adding diverse exudate cocktails negated the significant plant diversity effect on soil microbial properties. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that root exudate diversity is a crucial link between plant diversity and soil microorganisms.},

abstract = {The relationship between species diversity and the stability and production of trophic levels continues to receive intense scientific interest. Though facilitation is commonly cited as an essential underlying mechanism, few studies have provided evidence of the impact that indirect facilitation may have on diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. In this laboratory study, we examined the effect of zooplankton species diversity on trophic structure (total algal and zooplankton biomass) and temporal stability of total zooplankton biomass. We utilized four species of pond zooplankton grown in either monoculture or in polyculture. When comparing responses in polycultures with responses averaged across monocultures, a positive effect of diversity on total zooplankton biomass was observed. This occurred as a result of positive facilitative effects among competing zooplankton. Daphnia pulex, a biomass dominant in monoculture, was negatively affected by the presence of interspecific competitors. In contrast, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, a species that performed poorly in monoculture, was strongly and positively affected by the presence of interspecific competitors, driving positive diversity effects on total zooplankton biomass. Positive temporal covariances among zooplankton were detected in several polyculture replicates, increasing temporal variability of total zooplankton biomass. However, this destabilizing effect was weak relative to effects of high biomass yields in polyculture which caused temporal biomass variability (as measured by the coefficient of variation) to be lower in polyculture relative to monocultures. Zooplankton diversity effects on total algal biomass were not detected. However, increased zooplankton diversity significantly altered the size structure of algae, increasing the relative abundance of large, grazer-resistant algae.},

abstract = {Current research investigating the importance of diversity for biofuel lipid production remains limited. In contrast, the relationship between diversity and productivity within terrestrial and algal primary producers has been well documented in ecology. Hence, we set out to investigate, experimentally, whether diversity may also affect lipid production in micro-algae. We investigated the growth and lipid production of micro-algae using species from all major algal groups. Algae were grown in a large number of treatments differing in their diversity level. Additionally, we compared the growth and lipid production of laboratory communities to natural lake and pond phytoplankton communities of different diversity. Our results show that lipid production increased with increasing diversity in both natural and laboratory micro-algal communities. The underlying reason for the observed 'diversity-productivity' relationship seems to be resource use complementarity. We observed higher lipid production of highly diverse algal communities under the same growth and resource supply conditions compared to monocultures. Hence, the incorporation of the ecological advantages of diversity-related resource-use dynamics into algal biomass production may provide a powerful and cost effective way to improve biofuel production.},

We recognize communities of bacteria as integral and functionally important components of diverse habitats, ranging from soil collectives to the human microbiome. To function as productive communities, bacteria coordinate metabolic functions, often requiring shifts in growth and development. The hallmark of cellular development, which we characterize as physiological change in response to environmental stimuli, is a defining feature of many bacterial interspecies interactions. Bacterial communities rely on chemical exchanges to provide the cues for developmental change. Traditional methods in microbiology focus on isolation and characterization of bacteria in monoculture, separating the organisms from the surroundings in which interspecies chemical communication has relevance. Developing multispecies experimental systems that incorporate knowledge of bacterial physiology and metabolism with insights from biodiversity and metagenomics shows great promise for understanding interspecies chemical communication in the microbial world.},

abstract = {Understanding how changes in plant diversity affect agroecosystem functioning remains a key challenge. We examined how intercropping alfalfa, Medicago sativa, with orchardgrass, Dactylis glomerata, affects the potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae, its host plant (alfalfa), and the efficiency of a leafhopper predator, Nabis americoferus. In a field experiment, intercropping reduced the reproductive efficiency of the leafhopper. Nabis was more effective at reducing leafhopper abundance, and protecting alfalfa from hopperburn, in the polyculture than in the monoculture of alfalfa. In a series of laboratory experiments, we investigated mechanisms by which intercropping could enhance the efficiency of Nabis. Intercropping resulted in changes in vegetation structure and the spatial distribution of leafhoppers, but there was little evidence that these factors influenced the efficiency of Nabis. Instead, orchardgrass, a nonhost for leafhoppers, increased leafhopper movement, and Nabis captured leafhoppers more efficiently when the herbivores were more mobile. These results indicate that intercropping with nonhost plants promotes leafhopper movement and vulnerability to predation, and reveal a novel mechanism by which plant diversity can reduce herbivory. {\textcopyright} 2013 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

abstract = {Increased biodiversity may improve ecosystem services, including herbage yield. A mixture experiment was carried out at five sites in Northern Europe and one in Canada to investigate whether mixtures of grasses and legumes would give higher herbage yield than monocultures. Resistance of the mixtures to weed invasion and nutritive value of the herbage were also investigated. The experimental layout followed a simplex design, where four species differing in specific functional traits, timothy (Phleum pratense L.), smooth meadow grass (Poa pratensis L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.), were grown in monocultures and eleven different mixtures with systematically varying proportions of the four species. Positive diversity effects (DE) were observed, leading to greater herbage dry-matter (DM) yield in mixtures than expected from species sown in monocultures. For centroid mixtures, the DE generated on average an additional 32, 25 and 21% of the DM yield than would be expected from the monocultures in the first, second and third year respectively. On average, the mixtures were 9, 15 and 7% more productive than the most productive monoculture (transgressive overyielding) in the first, second and third year respectively. These benefits persisted over the three harvest years of the experiment and were consistent among most sites. This positive effect was not accompanied by a reduction in herbage digestibility and crude protein concentration that is usually observed with increased DM yield. Mixtures also reduced the invasion of weeds to <5% of herbage yield compared to monocultures (10–60% of herbage yield).},

abstract = {Aims Fine roots play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of terrestrial ecosystems and are vital for understanding forest ecosystem functioning and services. Higher plant species diversity has been largely reported to increase aboveground community biomass, but how biodiversity affects fine-root production and the related mechanisms in forests remain unclear. In this study, we aim to answer two questions: (i) does fine-root production increase with tree species richness? (ii) Can this effect be explained by niche complementarity among species? Methods We analyzed data from a large forest biodiversity experiment (BEF-China) with 5-year-old trees. Fine-root growth was measured as standing biomass and annual fine-root regrowth was estimated using ingrowth cores. Moreover, relative yield was calculated to test whether over-or under-yielding occurred when mixtures were compared with the average monoculture of the species included in the mixtures. We calculated functional diversity for fine-root (<= 2 mm in diameter) traits by Rao's quadratic entropy index for each species mixture. The effects of manipulated tree species richness and identity on fine-root traits were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Mixed models were also used to test the relationships between tree species richness and fine-root standing biomass, annual regrowth and vertical heterogeneity. Important Findings Fine roots of more than one species were found in half of the soil cores in mixtures indicating that belowground interactions in these young forest stands occurred much earlier than canopy closure. We found significant differences among species in fine-root traits such as diameter and specific root length (SRL), which suggested different resource-use strategies and niche partitioning among species. Mean fine-root diameter of species ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 mm, mean SRL ranged from 12.43 m.g(-1) to 70.22 m.g(-1) and mean vertical distribution index beta ranged from 0.68 to 0.93. There was a significant positive relationship between species richness and the evenness of the vertical distribution of fine-root standing biomass. Moreover, marginally significant positive relationships existed between species richness and standing biomass as well as annual regrowth of fine roots. Relative yields and Rao's quadratic entropy index were both not significantly affected by species richness. However, the relative yield of fine-root standing biomass was marginally correlated with Rao's quadratic entropy index, implying that belowground niche complementarity between species does contribute to diversity effects. In conclusion, our study showed positive effects of species richness on the filling of soil volume by fine roots in the studied experimental forest communities. This has positive effects on fine-root standing biomass and may also lead to increased aboveground biomass.},

abstract = {The population density of the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.), the species diversity of its predators, parasitism on eggs, larvae and pupae, and associated yield of canola were evaluated in experimental plots where spring canola was grown either as a monoculture or strip-intercropped with annual alfalfa in the ratio of 3C:3A, 6C:3A and 9C:3A over a 2-year period. The egg density was significantly higher in monoculture than in intercrops. The highest and lowest densities of larvae and pupae of DBM were recorded in monoculture (2.9–3.2 larvae per plant and 1.14–1.20 pupae per plant) and intercrop 3C:3A (0.7–0.6 larvae per plant and 0.34–0.29 pupae per plant), respectively. Shannon diversity index ( H' ) for species composition of the predators of DBM immature stages was lower in monoculture than in intercrops, and was similar amongst the three intercrops. Moreover, the percent parasitism for eggs, larvae and pupae was higher in intercrops than in monoculture. The dry seed weight loss was higher in monocrop (37.6–40.1%) compared to 3C:3A (7.9–8.6%), 6C:3A (19.5–21.4%) and 9C:3A (21.6–25.4%). Our results indicate that intercropping canola with annual alfalfa, especially in the ratio 3C:3A, can increase the species diversity, parasitism rates of DBM immature stages, and enhance the yield of canola. The implications of these findings, in relation to integrated pest management (IPM) in canola cropping systems, are discussed.},

abstract = {Native grasslands are valued for biodiversity and supporting dormant season grazing, but are prone to invasion. In western Canada, revegetation of Festuca campestris grasslands may be hindered by Poa pratensis, an invasive grass. To determine the competitive interaction of these species during establishment, two greenhouse experiments were conducted where F. campestris seedlings were planted in monocultures or mixtures with P. pratensis. The first experiment used equal-aged (3-month old) seedlings of both species, while the second experiment used unequal-aged seedlings (4-month-old F. campestris and 2-month-old P. pratensis). Seedling performance was measured in response to manipulations of water and nitrogen, defoliation, and plant neighbor. While water and nitrogen reduced the biomass and vegetative reproduction (tillering) of F. campestris, exposure to P. pratensis most strongly limited the growth of F. campestris seedlings regardless of other treatments. More frequent and consistent decreases in F. campestris due to P. pratensis were observed in older F. campestris seedlings than younger seedlings. Defoliation also reduced the growth of F. campestris, and the added presence of P. pratensis during defoliation further enhanced these reductions in younger, equal-aged bunchgrass seedlings. Overall, these results suggest that when restoring native F. campestris grasslands, early establishment may be improved by reducing the negative impacts of P. pratensis, and avoiding severe defoliation.},

We measured decomposition rates (mg g?1 d?1) of mixed-species leaf litter from two experimental designs: 1) a microcosm experiment with litterbags of species mixtures combining six tree species, alone and in 42 combinations, and 2) an in situ litterbag experiment with all possible mixture combinations of four herb species (from one to four species). Interaction strengths and directions were measured as deviations from community-weighted means (CWM) of monoculture decompo- sition values, following the biomass-ratio hypothesis (BRH). Functional diversity was measured as Lalibert{\'{e}} and Legendre's functional dispersion (FDis), using leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen and carbon contents, and proportions of water soluble compounds, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Correlations between FDis and deviations from BRH varied strongly, depending upon the combination of functional traits, the plant type or the environmental conditions, and the way in which prediction error was expressed (absolute or actual deviation). For tree species, FDis that was based on a combination of water soluble compounds, hemicellulose concentration, and LDMC was negatively correlated with interaction strength but positively with its absolute value. For herbs, interaction strength (absolute or actual) decreased as FDis of the mixtures increased, based on cellulose and lignin contents. There was no positive correlation between functional dispersion and the deviations from Grime's biomass-ratio hypothesis, with a null intercept. Despite a relation- ship between litter interactions and functional divergence, this relationship was not generalisable. Other functional traits that were missing in our study might have played an important role. Due},

abstract = {Background and AimsThe biomass-ratio hypothesis states that ecosystem properties are driven by the characteristics of dominant species in the community. In this study, the hypothesis was operationalized as community-weighted means (CWMs) of monoculture values and tested for predicting the decomposition of multispecies litter mixtures along an abiotic gradient in the field.MethodsDecomposition rates (mg g(-1) d(-1)) of litter from four herb species were measured using litter-bed experiments with the same soil at three sites in central France along a correlated climatic gradient of temperature and precipitation. All possible combinations from one to four species mixtures were tested over 28 weeks of incubation. Observed mixture decomposition rates were compared with those predicted by the biomass-ratio hypothesis. Variability of the prediction errors was compared with the species richness of the mixtures, across sites, and within sites over time.Key ResultsBoth positive and negative prediction errors occurred. Despite this, the biomass-ratio hypothesis was true as an average claim for all sites (r = 0{\textperiodcentered}91) and for each site separately, except for the climatically intermediate site, which showed mainly synergistic deviations. Variability decreased with increasing species richness and in less favourable climatic conditions for decomposition.ConclusionsCommunity-weighted mean values provided good predictions of mixed-species litter decomposition, converging to the predicted values with increasing species richness and in climates less favourable to decomposition. Under a context of climate change, abiotic variability would be important to take into account when predicting ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {Climatewarming is predicted to alter species interactions, which could potentially lead to extinction events. However, there is an ongoing debate whether the effects of warming on biodiversity may be moderated by biodiversity itself. We tested warming effects on soil nematodes, one of the most diverse and abundant metazoans in terrestrial ecosystems, along a gradient of environmental complexity created by a gradient of plant species richness. Warming increased nematode species diversity in complex (16-speciesmixtures) plant communities (by $\sim$36%) but decreaseditinsimple (monocultures) plant communities (by $\sim$39%) compared to ambient temperature. Further, warming led to higher levels of taxonomic relatedness in nematode communities across all levels of plant species richness. Our results highlight both the need for maintaining species-rich plant communities to help offset detrimental warming effects and the inability of species-rich plant communities to maintain nematode taxonomic distinctness when warming occur.},

abstract = {Soil food webs comprise a multitude of trophic interactions that can affect the composition and productivity of plant communities. Belowground predators feeding on microbial grazers like Collembola could decelerate nutrient mineralization by reducing microbial turnover in the soil, which in turn could negatively influence plant growth. However, empirical evidences for the ecological significance of belowground predators on nutrient cycling and plant communities are scarce. Here, we manipulated predator density (Hypoaspis aculeifer: predatory mite) with equal densities of three Collembola species as a prey in four functionally dissimilar plant communities in experimental microcosms: grass monoculture (Poa pratensis), herb monoculture (Rumex acetosa), legume monoculture (Trifolium pratense), and all three species as a mixed plant community. Density manipulation of predators allowed us to test for density-mediated effects of belowground predators on Collembola and lower trophic groups. We hypothesized that predator density will reduce Collembola population causing a decrease in nutrient mineralization and hence detrimentally affect plant growth. First, we found a density-dependent population change in predators, that is, an increase in low-density treatments, but a decrease in high-density treatments. Second, prey suppression was lower at high predator density, which caused a shift in the soil microbial community by increasing the fungal: bacterial biomass ratio, and an increase of nitrification rates, particularly in legume monocultures. Despite the increase in nutrient mineralization, legume monocultures performed worse at high predator density. Further, individual grass shoot biomass decreased in monocultures, while it increased in mixed plant communities with increasing predator density, which coincided with elevated soil N uptake by grasses. As a consequence, high predator density significantly increased plant complementarity effects indicating a decrease in interspecific plant competition. These results highlight that belowground predators can relax interspecific plant competition by increasing nutrient mineralization through their density-dependent cascading effects on detritivore and soil microbial communities.},

abstract = {Experimental studies with grassland species found a positive relationship between species richness and community biomass production, however the response of individual species was highly variable. The mechanisms behind these patterns are poorly understood. Here we studied aboveground biomass production and plasticity of growth characteristics of four legumes with similar morphology (Lotus corniculatus, Medicago lupulina, Onobrychis viciifolia, Trifolium hybridum) in experimental grasslands varying in species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60) and composition. We identified O. viciifolia and T. hybridum as species that reached higher biomass production in mixtures than expected from monoculture yields, while L. corniculatus and M. lupulina mostly had lower yields than expected. Variation of morphological traits across the species-richness gradient was lowest in the highly competitive O. viciifolia, but increased in the smaller species. The tall-growing O. viciifolia achieved higher biomass production by both, a higher number of plant individuals and an increase in mean mass per individual. Mean shoot number per individual remained constant, but individuals produced heavier shoots. The medium-sized T. hybridum also increased the number of plant individuals, but mean mass per individual did not respond to community species richness. The average mass per shoot was increased in mixtures, but the species developed less shoots per individual. Shoot length and stem weight ratio of T. hybridum increased with community species richness. Morphological changes in the less successful L. corniculatus and M. lupulina with a smaller growth stature were similarly directed as those of T. hybridum. The observed morphological changes are known as typical shade-avoidance mechanisms in dense vegetation. Our study shows that stress responses to changes in resource availability may be a mechanism to enforce higher aboveground biomass production of individual species in mixtures, but it depends on species identity whether trait plasticity is large enough to exceed stress-induced growth limitations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

abstract = {The native perennial Urtica dioica and the invasive alien annual Impatiens glandulifera often co-occur in European riparian herb communities. This paper aims to answer two questions: i) can l. glandulifera outcompete U. dioica: and ii) how does hydrology influence competition? Two mesocosm experiments assessed growth of, and competition between, the two species when subjected firstly to three water-table regimes and secondly to five flood treatments. Results indicated that both species preferred lower water-tables and that floods early in spring adversely affected their growth. Deposition of sediment during flooding appeared to have little effect. Presence of U. dioica appeared to inhibit germination and, in flooded treatments. growth of l. glandulifera. However, during the water-table experiment, U. dioica plants grown in mixed cultures with l. glandulifera showed significantly reduced growth at the end of season compared to those grown in monocultures. This indicates that. once established. l. glandulifera can have a negative effect on U. dioica. These results point to a rare case of an annual species, l. glandulifera, out-competing a perennial, U. dioica. They also have implications for the biodiversity and management of riparian habitats.},

abstract = {Species diversity is a major determinant of ecosystem productivity, stability, invasibility, and nutrient dynamics. Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change. The preservation, conservation, and restoration of biodiversity should be a high global priority.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Tixier M.-S. et al. Acarologia is under free license.Several species of the predatory mite family Phytoseiidae are of major economic importance for biological pest control in crops, including grapevines. Plant diversification in agrosystems is reported to enhance useful biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. Thus, agroforestry, which consists in co-planting trees and crops, is assumed to be a possible way to ensure regulation of pest outbreaks by phytoseiid mites. This paper investigates the effect of trees (Pinus pinea and Sorbus domestica) within vineyards on Phytoseiidae communities. Five experimental plots were considered, two where vines were co-planted with P. pinea and S. domestica, and three monoculture plots: vines, P. pinea and S. domestica. Sampling was carried out on vines and trees in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2010 and 2012. A higher Phytoseiidae diversity was observed in agroforestry plots than in monoculture plots. Kampimodromus aberrans (replacing T. [ T.] exhilaratus) seemed to colonize these plots 15 years after its plantation, especially when vines were co-planted with P. pinea. Factors affecting these faunistical changes are discussed. Effects on Phytoseiidae densities differed depending on grape cultivartree species associations. Factors affecting these interactions are discussed; plant diversity does not simply lead to a higher density and diversity of natural enemies.},

Those positive diversity effects resulted mostly from selection effects, primarily driven by fast-growing deciduous species and associated traits.

abstract = {1. There is a rising interest in the role of species diversity in ecosystem functioning and services, including productivity. Yet, how the diversity–productivity relationship depends on species identity and abiotic conditions remains a challenging issue. 2. We analysed mixture effects on species productivity along site productivity gradients, calculated from a set of abiotic factors, in two biogeographic contexts (highlands and lowlands). We compared the productivity of 5 two-species mixtures (i.e. 10 cases of mixed species) with that of monocultures of the same species. Five main European tree species were considered: sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), silver fir(Abies alba Mill.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst). 3. Our data set was compiled from the 2006 to 2010 French National Forest Inventory data base and covers 2361 plots including pure and mixed stands. 4. Overall productivity of mixtures in highlands, that is European beech–Norway spruce, European beech–silver fir and to a lesser extent, silver fir–Norway spruce, was found to be higher than expected from the productivity of corresponding monospecific stands. Overyielding was mainly due to European beech for the first two mixtures and to silver fir for the third one. 5. No effect of mixture was found for sessile oak–Scots pine and sessile oak–European beech stands in lowlands. Overyielding of sessile oak mixed with Scots pine was not strong enough to signifi- cantly increase overall stand productivity. Overyielding of European beech was balanced by an un- deryielding of sessile oak. 6. The mixture effect changed along site productivity gradients for six cases out of the 10 studied, with a stronger and positive effect on sites with low productivity. The magnitude of this change along site productivity gradients varied up to 89% depending on the tree species. 7. Synthesis. The nature of species interaction in mixtures with regard to productivity changes with species assemblage and abiotic conditions. Overyielding is strongest when species grow in highlands on less productive sites. A negative link between mixture effect and site productivity was found, in line with the stress-gradient hypothesis},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies have shown that genetic diversity within plant species can influence important ecological processes. Here, we report a two-year wetland mesocosm experiment in which genotypic richness of Phragmites australis was manipulated to examine its effects on primary productivity and nitrogen removal from water. We used six genotypes of P. australis, and compared primary productivity and nitrogen concentration in the outflow water of the mesocosms between monocultures and polycultures of all six genotypes. We also quantified the abundance of denitrifying bacteria, as denitrification is a primary mechanism of nitrogen removal in addition to the biotic uptake by P. australis. Plant productivity was significantly greater in genotypic polycultures compared to what was expected based on monocultures. This richness effect on productivity was driven by both complementary and competitive interactions among genotypes. In addition, nitrogen removal rates of mesocosms were generally greater in genotypic polycultures compared to those expected based on monocultures. This effect, particularly pronounced in autumn, may largely be attributable to the enhanced uptake of nitrogen by P. australis, as the abundance of nitrite reducers did not increase with plant genotypic diversity. Although our effect sizes were relatively small compared to previous experiments, our study emphasizes the effect of genotypic interactions in regulating multiple ecological processes.},

abstract = {A long standing ecological paradigm suggests that diverse plant communities should be more resistant to weed invasion compared with plant communities that have few species. Data from three separate studies were used to test the hypothesis that increased forage species diversity reduces weed invasion in pasture communities. The first study measured weed invasion in experimentally constructed pasture communities containing 1-15 species. A second experiment conducted in the greenhouse involved sowing a common perennial weed species, curly dock (Rumex crispus), into forage mixtures with 5 or 10 different forage species and three monocultures. The third study investigated the relationship between weed abundance and forage diversity in 37 pastures surveyed across the northeastern United States. Consistent negative relationships between forage species diversity and weed abundance were found. The causal mechanisms explaining the negative relationships between forage diversity and weed invasion were difficult to delineate since diversity was often correlated with highly productive pasture communities. The results suggest that maintaining both productive pasture communities (> 150 g m-2of aboveground biomass) and an evenly distributed array of forage species should be combined to effectively reduce weed invasion. Managing pastures for increased forage species diversity could be a useful cultural control method for weeds. Increasing the diversity of forage plants also has other ecosystem benefits to pasture communities (e.g., greater primary production, stability) beyond that of weed suppression. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Complementary resource use has often been claimed to explain positive effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning, but the underlying mechanisms of complementarity have rarely been directly quantified in forest systems. The aim of this study was to characterize spatial and temporal water uptake of subtropical tree saplings, to assess the role of interspecific interaction on water uptake patterns and to quantify species niche breadth and overlap. Our experiment comprised two deciduous (Castanea henryi, Quercus serrata) and two evergreen tree species (Elaeocarpus decipiens, Schima superba) that were each planted in monoculture and 4-species mixture. We used deuterium-enriched water to trace seasonal water uptake from 5 cm and 20 cm soil depth. Castanea exploited predominantly the upper soil (74% of overall tracer uptake across treatments) whereas Quercus (50%), Elaeocarpus (57%) and Schima (62%) tended to use both soil layers more equally. Species identity had an overall significant effect on isotopic enrichment in stem water. There was no effect of species richness: niche breadth and overlap of single species was not affected by interspecific interactions in mixtures. Niche overlap between deciduous species was lowest (74%) whereas the two evergreen species had similar water uptake patterns (91%). According to our results, interspecific competition did not alter water uptake patterns of the studied species during the early phase of forest establishment. Thus, soil water uptake complementarity could only occur through inherent (fundamental) specific differences in water uptake niches based on sapling specialization, while phenotypic adjustments to interspecific interaction or neighbor diversity are less important.},

Three different components of invasibility, i.e. species richness, abundance and rarity of invaders, have been monitored in experimental plots where the resident diversity ranged from monocultures to 18-species mixtures. Invaders' richness and abundance were negatively correlated to the resident diversity, while the occurrence of rare invaders was strongly positively correlated to the resident diversity. Standing biomass explained also a significant part of the variation of communities' invasibility. Soil nutrients and structural traits of the constructed vegetation such as the space-filling showed no influence in the definition of the overall pattern of invasibility in these communities. A verbal model of selection of invaders at the neighbourhood scale is proposed to explain these diverging trends of invasibility.},

abstract = {1 Although experimental studies usually reveal that resistance to invasion increases with species diversity, observational studies sometimes show the opposite trend. The higher resistance of diverse plots to invasion may be partly due to the increased probability of a plot containing a species with similar resource requirements to the invader. 2 We conducted a study of the invasibility of monocultures belonging to three different functional groups by seven sown species of legume. By only using experimentally established monocultures, rather than manipulating the abundance of particular functional groups, we removed both species diversity and differences in underlying abiotic conditions as potentially confounding variables. 3 We found that legume monocultures were more resistant than monocultures of grasses or non-leguminous forbs to invasion by sown legumes but not to invasion by other unsown species. The functional group effect remained after controlling for differences in total biomass and the average height of the above-ground biomass. 4 The relative success of legume species and types also varied with monoculture characteristics. The proportional biomass of climbing legumes increased strongly with biomass height in non-leguminous forb monocultures, while it declined with biomass height in grass monocultures. Trifolium pratense was the most successful invader in grass monocultures, while Vicia cracca was the most successful in non-leguminous forb monocultures. 5 Our results suggest that non-random assembly rules operate in grassland communities both between and within functional groups. Legume invaders found it much more difficult to invade legume plots, while grass and non-leguminous forb plots favoured non-climbing and climbing legumes, respectively. If plots mimic monospecific patches, the effect of these assembly rules in diverse communities might depend upon the patch structure of diverse communities. This dependency on patch structure may contribute to differences in results of research from experimental vs. natural communities.},

abstract = {General principles from coexistence theory are often invoked to explain how and why mixtures of species outperform monocultures. However, the complementarity and selection effects commonly measured in biodiversity experiments do not precisely quantify the niche and relative fitness differences that govern species coexistence. Given this lack of direct correspondence, how can we know whether species-rich mixtures are stable and that the benefits of diversity will therefore persist? We develop a resource-based included-niche model in which plant species have asymmetric access to a nested set of belowground resource pools. We use the model to show that positive complementarity effects arise from stabilising niche differences, but do not necessarily lead to stable coexistence and hence can be transient. In addition, these transient complementarity effects occur in the model when there is no complementary resource use among species. Including a trade-off between uptake rates and the size of the resource pool stabilised interactions and led to persistent complementarity coupled with weak or negative selection effects, consistent with results from the longest-running field biodiversity experiments. We suggest that future progress requires a greater mechanistic understanding of the links between ecosystem functions and their underlying biological processes.},

abstract = {The ontogenetic niche concept predicts that resource use depends on an organism's developmental stage. This concept has been investigated primarily in animals that show differing resource use strategies as juveniles and as adults, such as amphibians. We studied resource use and performance in the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus (Orthoptera, Acrididae) provided with food plant mixtures of either one, three or eight plant species throughout their development. C. parallelus survival and fecundity was highest in the food plant mixture with eight plant species and lowest in the treatments where only one single plant species was offered as food. C. parallelus' consumption throughout its ontogeny depended on sex, and feeding on different plant species was dependent on a grasshopper's developmental stage. To depict grasshopper foraging in food plant mixtures compared to foraging on single plant species, we introduce the term "relative forage total" (RFT) based on an approach used in biodiversity research by Loreau and Hector (Nature 413:548-274, 2001). RFT of grasshoppers in food plant mixtures was always higher than what would have been expected from foraging in monocultures. The increase in food consumption was due to an overall increase in feeding on plant species in mixtures compared to consumption of the same species offered as a single diet. Thus we argue that grasshopper foraging exhibits complementarity effects. Our results reinforce the necessity to consider development-related changes in insect herbivore feeding. Thorough information on the feeding ontogeny of insect herbivores could not only elucidate their nutritional ecology but also help to shed light on their functional role in plant communities.},

abstract = {Putative future increase in atmospheric CO2 is expected to adversely affect herbivore growth due to decrease in contents of key nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus (P) relative to carbon in primary producers including plant and algal species. However, as many herbivores are polyphagous and as the response of primary producers to elevated CO2 is highly species-specific, effects of elevated CO2 on herbivore growth may differ between feeding conditions with monospecific and multiproducer diets. To examine this possibility, we performed CO2 manipulation experiments under a P-limited condition with a planktonic herbivore, Daphnia, and three algal species, Scenedesmus obliquus (green algae), Cyclotella sp. (diatoms) and Synechococcus sp. (cyanobacteria). Semibatch cultures with single algal species (monocultures) and multiple algal species (mixed cultures) were grown at ambient (360 ppm) and high CO2 levels (2000 ppm) that were within the natural range in lakes. Both in the mono-and mixed cultures, algal steady state abundance increased but algal P:C and N:C ratios decreased when they were grown at high CO2. As expected, Daphnia fed monospecific algae cultured at high CO2 had decreased growth rates despite increased algal abundance. However, when fed mixed algae cultured at high CO2, especially consisting of diatoms and cyanobacteria or the three algal species, Daphnia maintained high growth rates despite lowered P and N contents relative to C in the algal diets. These results imply that algal diets composed of multiple species can mitigate the adverse effects of elevated CO2 on herbivore performance, although the magnitude of this mitigation depends on the composition of algal species involved in the diets.},

abstract = {The efficiency by which communities capture limiting resources may be related to the number of species or functional types competing therein. This is because species use different resources (i.e. complementarity effect) or because species-rich communities include species with extreme functional traits (positive selection effect). We conducted two manipulative studies to separate the effects of functional richness and functional identity on the feeding efficiency (i.e. filtration rate) of suspension-feeding invertebrates growing on vertical surfaces. In addition, one experiment tested whether the density of organisms influences the effect of functional diversity. Monocultures and complete mixtures of functional types were fed with a solution of microalgae of different sizes (6 $\mu$m-40 $\mu$m). Experiments conducted at two locations, Helgoland and Plymouth, showed that functional identity had far larger effects on filtration rate than richness. Mixtures did not outperform the average monoculture or the best-performing monoculture and this pattern was independent on density. The high efficiency of one of the functional types in consuming most microalgae could have minimised the resource complementarity. The loss or gain of particular species may therefore have a stronger impact on the functioning of epibenthic communities than richness per se. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1.Biodiversity can insure ecosystems against declines in their functioning by increasing the mean level of ecosystem processes and decreasing the spatial or temporal variance of these processes. On this basis, mixing tree species is expected to be an effective management strategy to reduce the risk of planting failure in young plantations.2.We examined the effects of diversity insurance on sapling survival in three tree diversity experiments across Belgium. Based on the survival scoring of 89 254 saplings, planted in 126 plots with up to four species mixtures, we tested two hypotheses: (i) variability in plot-level survival is lower for mixtures compared to monocultures due to compensation among the species (i.e. buffering effect) and (ii) mean survival is higher due to facilitation (i.e. performance-enhancing effect).3.Variation in plot-level survival decreased strongly with diversity, indicating a buffering effect. The risk of severe planting failure was reduced in mixtures because species exhibit different survival rates; therefore, mixing ensures that not all trees in the plantation are equally susceptible to environmental stressors. In contrast, the mean plot-level survival did not increase with diversity, and thus an overall performance-enhancing effect was lacking. However, species-level analyses did show performance-enhancing effects, where some species profited from mixing while others did not.4.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that biodiversity through mixing tree species insures young experimental plantations against planting failure and is therefore highly recommended as a planting management strategy. The risk of large mortality gaps is reduced if tree plantation saplings are mixed at the scale of individual trees or small cells of trees.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {(Abstract) Global warming impacts natural communities through effects on performance of individual species and through changes in the strength of interactions between them. While there is a body of evidence of the former, we lack experimental evidence on potential changes in interaction strengths. Knowledge about multispecies interactions is fundamental to understand the regulation of biodiversity and the impact of climate change on communities. This study investigated the effect of warming on a simplified community consisting of three species: rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea feeding on plantain, Plantago lanceolata, and a heterospecific neighbouring plant species, perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne. The aphid does not feed on L. perenne. The experimental design consisted of monocultures and mixtures of L. perenne and P. lanceolata at three temperature levels. We did not find indication for indirect temperature effects on D. plantaginea through changes in leaf nitrogen or relative water content. However, experimental warming affected the life history traits of the aphid directly, in a non-linear manner. Aphids performed best at moderate warming, where they grew faster and had a shorter generation time. In spite of the increased population growth of the aphids under warming, the herbivory rates were not changed and consequently the plant-herbivore interaction was not altered under warming. This suggests reduced consumption rates at higher temperature. Also plant competition affected the aphids but through an interaction with temperature. We provide proof-of-concept that net interactions between plants and herbivores should not change under warming despite direct effects of warming on herbivores when plant-plant interaction are considered. Our study stresses the importance of indirect non–trophic interactions as an additional layer of complexity to improve our understanding of how trophic interactions will alter under climate change.},

abstract = {For the purpose of feeding value, drought resistance and nitrogen utilization, other grasses (e.g. Festuca arundinacea and Dactylis glomerata) than the currently widely used perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne) are introduced in dairy farming, either as a monoculture or in a mixture. To study the effect of these grasses on yield and soil chemical and biological quality, the three species were sown in a field experiment in monoculture and in two mixtures. Within two growing seasons, the grass species tested under high soil fertility conditions did not show significant effects on most of the tested soil biological parameters. Only for the mixture of L. perenne and D. glomerata a higher soil NO3-and mineral N content were most probably related to a higher bacterial activity, possibly induced by dying roots of L. perenne. This was the likely cause of the high aboveground dry matter yield of this mixture. The N-efficiencies of the monocultures of L. perenne, F. arundinacea and D. glomerata were not different when only considering the aboveground biomass. In L. perenne and F. arundinacea the total N in root biomass was higher while under D. glomerata the NO3-in the soil was higher. The lower fraction of mineral N to total N for L. perenne, F. arundinacea and the mixture of the two suggests that their organic matter build-up/mineralization ratio was higher than for D. glomerata. Furthermore, the mixture of L. perenne and F. arundinacea showed significantly lower soil mineral N levels than the monocultures of each. We conclude that grassland systems with a mixture of L. perenne and F. arundinacea are more sustainable than the monocultures of each, in terms of reduction of nitrogen losses and the build-up of soil organic matter. D. glomerata should only be used in a mixture in which the companion grass(es) are maintained. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Ecological mechanisms underlying these impacts are well studied, but the role of evolutionary processes is rarely assessed. Using a long-term field experiment, we tested whether natural selection in plant communities increased biodiversity effects on productivity. We re-assembled communities with 8- year co-selection history adjacent to communities with identical species composition but no his- tory of co-selection (‘na€ ıve communities'). Monocultures, and in particular mixtures of two to four co-selected species, were more productive than their corresponding na€ ıve communities over 4 years in soils with or without co-selected microbial communities. At the highest diversity level of eight plant species, no such differences were observed. Our findings suggest that plant commu- nity evolution can lead to rapid increases in ecosystem functioning at low diversity but may take longer at high diversity. This effect was not modified by treatments simulating co-evolutionary processes between plants and soil organisms. Keywords},

abstract = {Dominance by free-floating plants results in a loss of plant species in many waters. An important source for re-establishment of non-floating aquatic plants can be the propagule bank. This study focuses on whether the propag- ule bank of free-floating plant–dominated ditch sediments can serve as potential source for recovery of a diverse plant community. The first objective was to determine differ- ences in propagule germination from sediments of ditches in the Netherlands that differ in vegetation composition through a seedling-emergence experiment. The second objective was to analyze the effect of sediment disturbance on the number of germinating propagules. The results show that, compared to sediments from ditches with submerged vegetation, sediments from free-floating plant–dominated ditches produced significantly lower numbers of indi- viduals and species of submerged and emergent plants, while numbers of individuals and species of free-floating plants were higher. These results suggest that sediments from free-floating plant–dominated ditches have lower potential to recover a diverse plant community proba- bly resulting from positive feedback mechanisms caused by the vegetation present, maintaining the free-floating plant–dominated state. Sediment disturbance strongly favors the germination of free-floating plant propagules, especially from free-floating plant–dominated ditch sedi- ments. Ditch maintenance activities such as mowing and dredging will therefore likely favor persistence of the free- floating plant–dominated state. To shift from dominance by free-floating plants to a more diverse plant community, alternativemaintenance methods should be considered that cause less sediment disturbance together with measures that promote colonization such as temporary drawdown or re-introduction of species.},

abstract = {Climate-driven and biodiversity effects on the structure and functioning of ecosystems are increasingly studied as multiple stressors, which subsequently may influence species invasions. We used a mesocosm experiment to test how increases in temperature and CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) interact with functional diversity of resident macroalgal assemblages and affect the invasion success of the non-indigenous macroalga Sargassum muticum. Early settlement of S. muticum germlings was assessed in the laboratory under common environmental conditions across three monocultures and a polyculture of functional groups of native macroalgae, which had previously grown for 3 weeks under crossed treatments of temperature and pCO2. Functional diversity was a key driver shaping early settlement of the invader, with significant identity and richness effects: higher settlement occurred in low-diversity and low-stature assemblages, even after accounting for treatment biomass. Overall, early survivorship of settled germlings responded to an interaction of temperature and pCO2 treatments, with survivorship enhanced in one treatment (high pCO2 at ambient Temperature) after 3 days, and reduced in another (ambient pCO2 at high Temperature) after 10 days, although size was enhanced in this same treatment. After 6 months in the field, legacy effects of laboratory treatments remained, with S. muticum reaching higher cover in most assemblages previously subjected to ambient pCO2, but ephemeral green algae appearing disproportionately after elevated-pCO2 treatment. These results caution that invasion outcomes may change at multiple points in the life cycle under higher-CO2, higher-temperature conditions, in addition to supporting a role for intact, functionally diverse assemblages in limiting invader colonization.},

abstract = {Diverse plant communities are predicted to have higher abundance of predators as compared to species-poor ones. In this study we explored whether this prediction holds true for the abundance of predatory arthropods in forest ecosystems, which have been poorly studied in this respect. We collected ground-dwelling arthropods using pitfall traps from six long-term forest diversity experiments in Finland, Sweden and UK. The effects of tree species diversity on abundance of five main groups of predatory arthropods (ants, spiders, carabids, staphylinids and opilionids) were examined by means of meta-analysis. Overall, the diversity of tree species did not affect abundances of predators with the exception of staphylinids, which were more abundant in mixed stands than in monocultures. However, the effects of stand diversity on predator abundance became apparent when analyses were conducted on tree species basis. Preference for stands containing particular tree species was clear in the case of opilionids, carabids and staphylinids, and these preferences overruled the effects of tree species diversity in comparisons between monocultures and mixed stands containing the same tree species. Tree species diversity effects on predator abundance were furthermore mediated by the tree age, plot size and planting density used in the experiment. Overall, our results show that predator abundance does not increase uniformly with increase in tree species diversity, but rather suggest that predators have distinct preferences for stands composed of particular tree species and that these species preferences may overrule the effects of diversity.},

abstract = {In soft-bottom sediments, consumers may influence ecosystem function more via engineering that alters abiotic resources than through trophic influences. Understanding the influence of bioturbation on physical, chemical, and biological processes of the water-sediment interface requires investigating top-down (consumer) and bottom-up (resource) forces. The objective of the present study was to determine how consumer bioturbation mode and sediment properties interact to dictate the hydrologie function of experimental filtration systems clogged by the deposition of fine sediments. Three fine-grained sediments characterized by different organic matter (OM) and pollu- tant content were used to assess the influence of resource type: sediment of urban origin highly loaded with OM and pollutants, river sediments rich in OM, and river sediments poor in OM content. The effects of consumer bioturbation (chironomid larvae vs. tubificid worms) on sediment reworking, changes in hydraulic head and hydraulic conductivity, and water fluxes through the water-sediment interface were measured. Invertebrate influences in reducing the clogging process depended not only on the mode of bioturbation (construction of biogenic structures, burrowing and feeding activities, etc.) but also on the interaction between the bioturbation process and the sediments of the clogging layer. We present a conceptual model that highlights the importance of sediment influences on bioturbation and argues for the integration of bottom-up influence on consumer engineering activities.},

abstract = {Context – During the last two decades, functional biodiversity research has provided strong support for the hypothesis that more biodiverse ecosystems have the potential to deliver more and better services. However, most empirical support for this hypothesis comes from simple structured communities that are relatively easy to manipulate. The impact of forest biodiversity on forest ecosystem functioning has been far less studied. Experiment design – In this paper, we present the recently established, large-scale FORBIO experiment (FORest BIOdiversity and Ecosystem Functioning), specifically designed to test the effects of tree species diversity on forest ecosystem functioning. FORBIO's design matches with that of the few other tree diversity experiments worldwide, but at the same time, the FORBIO experiment is unique as it consists of a similar experimental set-up at three sites in Belgium (Zedelgem, Hechtel-Eksel and Gedinne) with contrasting edaphic and climatological characteristics. This design will help to provide answers to one of the most interesting unresolved questions in functional biodiversity research, notably whether the effects of complementarity on ecosystem functioning decrease in less stressful and more productive environments. At each site, FORBIO consists of 41 to 44 plots (127 plots in total) planted with monocultures and mixtures up to four species, selected from a pool of five site-adapted, functionally different tree species. When allocating the treatments to the plots, we maximally avoided any possible covariation between environmental factors. Monitoring of ecosystem functioning already started at the Zedelgem and Gedinne sites and will start soon in Hechtel-Eksel. Multiple processes are being measured and as the trees grow older, we plan to add even more processes. Expected results – Not only basic science, but also forest management will benefit from the results coming from the FORBIO experiment, as FORBIO is, for instance, also a test case for uncommon, not well-known tree species mixtures. To conclude, FORBIO is an important ecosystem experiment that has the potential to deliver badly needed insights into the multiple relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, which will be valuable for both science and practice.},

abstract = {Positive diversity-productivity relationships have repeatedly been found in experimental grassland plots, but mechanistic explanations are still under debate. We tested whether complementarity for the exploitation of the soil water resource helps to explain these relationships. In the dry summer of 2003, evapotranspiration (ET) was assessed at the Swedish BIODEPTH site using two different approaches: snapshot measurements of canopy surface temperature and simulation of time-accumulated ET by means of a soil water balance model. More diverse plots were characterized by lower surface temperatures and higher accumulated ET. Transgressive overyielding tests revealed that ET in polycultures was higher than in the best-performing monocultures, but this pattern was reversed at high degrees of water stress. Our results indicate that a more complete exploitation of soil water by more diverse grassland systems is on the one hand likely to be a driver for their increased biomass production, but on the other hand causes the more diverse communities to be affected earlier by drought. Nevertheless, the results also suggest that productivity may (at least partially) be maintained under dry conditions due to the higher likelihood of including drought-tolerant species in the more diverse communities.},

abstract = {Biological invasions and climate warming are two major threats to the world's biodiversity. To date, their impacts have largely been considered independently, despite indications that climate warming may increase the success of many invasive alien species. We therefore set up an experiment to study competition between native and invasive alien plant species and the effects of climate warming thereon. Two highly invasive alien plant species in Belgium, each with a native competitor that dominated in invaded sites, were grown either together (1:1 mixtures) or in isolation (monocultures) at ambient and elevated temperature (+3°C) in climate-controlled chambers. To detect possible mechanisms underlying the effects of competition and elevated temperature, we conducted a combined growth and nitrogen uptake analysis. In one pair, Senecio inaequidens – Plantago lanceolata (alien invasive – native), the alien species dominated in mixture, while in the other pair, Solidago gigantea – Epilobium hirsutum, the native species dominated. Climate warming reduced the invader dominance in the first species pair, but stimulated the suppressed invader in the latter. Many of the biomass responses for these two species pairs could be traced to the root-specific nitrogen uptake capacity. The responses of the native-invasive interaction to warming could not always be extrapolated from the monoculture responses, pointing to the necessity for experiments that take into account species interactions.},

Eight plant strategies, differing only in the time of onset of flowering, were played against one another to determine the relationship between plant trait differences and CE versus SE. 3.We show that competitive exclusion may occur even in the presence of a positive complementarity effect, i.e. when CE > 0. CE was highest at intermediate differences in flowering time. Increasing trait differences may therefore increase CE without leading to co-existence. 4.SE was strongly dependent on which of the strategies was paired. SE was mostly positive if one of the players was early flowering (with low seed yield) and the other strategy had higher monoculture yields. SE was mostly negative if one of the players was late flowering, leading to low monoculture yield for this strategy, but to high gains when competing with strategies that produce less leaf area. The average SE was negative over all pairs. 5.Synthesis. These results show that CE may be positive if the species interaction is beneficial for only one of the two competitors, and the sign of SE depends critically on the underlying mechanism for performance in monoculture. Positive complementarity may go hand in hand with competitive exclusion, while widely different outcomes in SE are possible within a single mechanistic background. Consequently, the way SE changes with increasing richness is not only related to a sampling/ selection effect, but also by the way the interacting species affect the competitive environment. Interpreting the additive partitioning method with a set notion in mind about the driving mechanisms could lead to incorrect conclusions on how species richness effects drive ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Aims Many experiments have shown a positive effect of species richness on productivity in grassland plant communities. However, it is poorly understood how environmental conditions affect this relationship. We aimed to test whether deep soil and limiting nutrient conditions increase the complementarity effect (CE) of species richness due to enhanced potential for resource partitioning. Methods We grew monocultures and mixtures of four common grassland species in pots on shallow and deep soil, factorially combined with two nutrient levels. Soil volume was kept constant to avoid confounding soil depth and volume. Using an additive partitioning method, we separated biodiversity effects on plant productivity into components due to species complementarity and dominance. Important findings Net biodiversity and complementarity effects were consistently higher in shallow pots, which was unexpected, and at the low nutrient level. These two results suggest that although belowground partitioning of resources was important, especially under low nutrient conditions, it was not due to differences in rooting depths. We conclude that in our experiment (i) horizontal root segregation might have been more important than the partitioning of rooting depths and (ii) that the positive effects of deep soil found in other studies were due to the combination of deeper soil with larger soil Volume.},

Location: Krompoort, a farm located on the northern footslopes of the Groot Winterhoek mountains, near Kirkwood, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Methods: We planted, in degraded, intact and three differently aged post-restoration (P. afra truncheons) sites, nursery-propagated individuals of two woody canopy dominants (Pappea capensis and Searsia longispina), and two inter-canopy shrubs (Lycium ferocissimum and Rhigozum obovatum) in Sep 2008 (spring). The experiment was repeated again in May 2009 (autumn) and a succulent canopy species (P. afra) was added. We assessed restoration success in terms of the survival of planted individuals after 24 mo (spring planting) and 12 mo (autumn planting). The estimated cost of a restoration effort to establish two woody canopy dominant species with the large-scale planting of P. afra was calculated and compared with that of the already established protocol of planting only P. afra truncheons. Results: Survival after spring (24 mo) and autumn (12 mo) plantings of the two woody canopy species was less than 5%, whereas survival of L. ferocissimum was low (19%), R. obovatum good (70%) and P. afra excellent (100%). Contrary to expectations, survival was not related to a gradient of intactness encompassing degraded, restoration and intact treatments that are associated with increasing biomass and soil carbon. The costs of incorporating the four woody canopy species into the restoration programme's protocol were 2.4 times the costs of restoring with P. afra alone. Conclusions: Planting propagules of canopy species other than P. afra is likely to render the programme economically unfeasible, depending on the price of carbon. We conclude that biodiversity goals for the restoration programme are better achieved via spontaneous recruitment of woody canopy and other species, even though this may take more than 40 yr post restoration.},

abstract = {Previous grassland biodiversity experiments were carried out in uniform environments. It is conceivable, however, that biodiversity effects on community characteristics such as primary productivity might be enhanced under more realistic levels of environmental heterogeneity, if this allows complementary resource use by different species in mixture. Therefore, we would expect larger complementarity effects between species in a heterogeneous environment than in a uniform environment. We tested these hypotheses with experiments in four non-overlapping species pools containing the three functional groups grasses, herbs and legumes. We established all species in monoculture, 3- and 6-species mixture on plots with horizontally heterogeneous or uniform distribution of the same total amount of soil nutrients. The positive net biodiversity effects on aboveground biomass production were similar in both heterogeneous and uniform environment. When the net biodiversity effects were partitioned into components, however, it became clear that in the heterogeneous environment they were due to increased complementarity among species whereas in the uniform environment dominance of species with high monoculture yield played also an important role. {\textcopyright} 2007 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

Little is known about the direct mechanisms that cause this result.We tested if by occupying different heights and depths above and below ground, and by opti- mizing the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen, species in mixtures can contribute to increased resource uptake and, thus, increased pro- ductivity of the community in comparison with monocultures. Methods We grew 24 grassland plant species, grouped into four nonoverlap- ping species pools, in monoculture and 3- and 6-species mixture in spatially heterogeneous and uniform soil nutrient conditions. Lay- ered harvests of above- and belowground biomass, as well as leaf nitrogen and light measurements, were taken to assess vertical can- opy and root space structure. Important Findings The distribution of leaf mass was shifted toward greater heights and light absorption was correspondingly enhanced in mixtures. How- ever, only some mixtures had leaf nitrogen concentration profiles predicted to optimize whole-community carbon gain, whereas in other mixtures species seemed to behave more ‘selfish'. Neverthe- less, even in these communities, biomass production increased with species richness. The distribution of root biomass below ground did not change from monocultures to three- and six-species mixtures and there was also no indication that mixtures were better than mono- cultures at extracting heterogeneously as compared to homoge- neously distributed soil resources. We conclude that positive biodiversity effect on aboveground biomass production cannot easily be explained by a single or few common mechanisms of differential space use. Rather, it seems that mechanisms vary with the particular set of species combined in a community.},

abstract = {The effects of principal mechanisms (selection and complementarity) of biodiversity on ecosystem functionality have been well studied. However, it remains unknown how environmental conditions affect the relative strength of these two mechanisms. To answer this question, a controlled pot experiment was conducted in which species diversity was manipulated in low (natural soil) and high stress (mine tailing) plots, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the principal mechanism underlying the increasing biomass shifts from the selection to complementarity with increasing abiotic stress. The shift occurs because species interactions varied with increasing abiotic stress. Competition prevails in low stress plots, while facilitation dominates in high stress plots. In low stress plots, the monoculture biomass of a specific species is a good indicator of the competitive ability of that species in the mixture, and the dominant species significantly affects the plot biomass. In high stress plots, the tolerance indexes of all individual species increase with the manipulated species richness, providing clear evidence for the increasing role of facilitation.},

The effects of the grass species Lolium perenne L. and nine dicotyledonous grassland species, grown in monocultures and two-species mixtures, on (i) the soil microbial biomass, (ii) the respiration: biomass ratio and (iii) plant litter decomposition was investigated in a glasshouse experiment. 2. Microbial biomass was sometimes greater and sometimes less in the two-species mixtures than could be explained in terms of the additive effects of the two component species grown singly; this variation was independent of differences in below-ground plant productivity between monoculture and mixture treatments. 3. The microbial respiration: biomass ratios and plant litter decomposition rates in the two-species mixture treatments were either greater or less than expected based on the monoculture treatments; these differences were dependent on the combinations of species present. Because the respiration: biomass ratio is a measure of ecosystem stability, it is here proposed that stability does not respond predictably to shifts in species diversity. 4. These results provide evidence that increasing plant species richness (from one to two species) has the potential to influence soil processes positively or negatively in a non-additive way. The possible ecological implications of this are discussed.},

abstract = {Although there has been much recent interest in the effect of litter mixing on decomposition processes, much remains unknown about how litter mixing and diversity affects the abundance and diversity of decomposer organisms. We conducted a litter mixing experiment using litterbags in a New Zealand rainforest, in which treatments consisted of litter monocultures of each of 8 forest canopy and understory plant species, as well as mixtures of 2, 4 and 8 species. We found litter mixing to have little effect on net decomposition rates after either 279 or 658 days, and for each species decomposition rates in mixture treatments were the same as in monoculture. Litter species identity had important effects on litter microfauna, mesofauna and macrofauna, with different litter types promoting different subsets of the fauna. Litter mixing had few effects on densities of mesofauna and macrofauna, but did have some important effects on components of the microfauna, notably microbe-feeding and predatory nematodes. At day 279, litter mixing also consistently reduced the ratio of bacterial-feeding to microbe-feeding (bacterial-feeding+fungal-feeding) nematodes, pointing to mixing causing a significant switch from the bacterial-based to the fungal-based energy channel. Litter mixing sometimes influenced the community composition and diversity of nematodes and macrofauna, but effects of litter mixing on diversity were not necessarily positive, and were much weaker than effects of litter species identity on diversity. We conclude that litter mixing effects on the abundance and diversity of decomposer biota, when they occur, are likely to be of secondary and generally minor significance when compared to the effects of litter species identity and composition. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is currently much debate about the relative importance of two contrasting mechanisms thought to be involved in regulating plant communities. One of these mechanisms is thought to result from species which possess particular traits, becoming dominant within the community and thus determining the abundance of other species. The second mechanism is thought to result from the complementarity of different species exploiting different resources and thus promoting co-existence. To investigate the relevant importance of these two mechanisms, a series of pot experiments were performed in which the competitive relationships of eight species of grass were estimated in monoculture, in pair-wise comparisons and by the impact of their removal on the remaining community. Although superficially above-ground biomass appeared to be a good predictor of competitive ability, more detailed analysis revealed that size was ineffective as a predictor of a species' impact on a community. In contrast there was evidence that complementarity was important in determining species-species interactions both at the level of pairs of species and even more so at community level. It is argued that complementarity is more important in diverse communities than in pair-wise interactions because complementarity is an emergent property of species diversity.},

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Ecological trade-offs are fundamental to theory in community ecology; critical for understanding species coexistence in diverse plant communities, as well as the evolution of diverse life-history strategies. Invasions by exotic species can provide insights into the importance of trade-offs in community assembly, because the ecological strategies of invading species often differ from those present in the native species pool. Exotic annual species have invaded many Mediterranean-climate areas around the globe, and often germinate and emerge earlier in the growing season than native species. Early-season growth can enable exotic annual species to preempt space and resources, competitively suppressing later-emerging native species; however, early-emerging individuals may also be more apparent to herbivores. This suggests a potential trade-off between seasonal phenology and susceptibility to herbivory. To evaluate this hypothesis, we monitored the emergence and growth of 12 focal species (six each native and exotic) in monoculture and polyculture, while experimentally excluding generalist herbivores both early and later in the growing season. Consistent with past studies, the exotic species emerged earlier than native species. Regardless of species origin, earlier-emerging species achieved greater biomass by the end of the experiment, but were more negatively impacted by herbivory, particularly in the early part of the growing season. This greater impact of early-season herbivory on early-active species led to a reduction in the competitive advantage of exotic species growing in polyculture, and improved the performance of later-emerging natives. Such a trade-off between early growth and susceptibility to herbivores could be an important force in community assembly in seasonal herbaceous-dominated ecosystems. These results also show how herbivore exclusion favors early-active exotic species in this system, with important implications for management in many areas invaded by early-active exotic species.},

abstract = {Modern grassland management seeks to pro-vide many ecosystem services and experimental studies in resource-poor grasslands have shown a positive relationship between plant species richness and a variety of ecosystem functions. Thus, increasing species richness might help to enhance multifunctionality in managed grasslands if the rela-tionship between species richness and ecosystem functioning is equally valid in high-input grassland systems. We tested the relative effects of low-input to high-input management intensities and low to high plant species rich-ness. Using a combination of mowing frequencies (1, 2 or 4 cuts per season) and fertilisation levels (0, 100 and 200 kg N ha −1 a −1), we studied the productivity of 78 exper-imental grassland communities of increasing plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 species with 1 to 4 functional groups) in two successive years. Our results showed that in both years higher diversity was more effective in increasing productivity than higher man-agement intensity: the 16-species mixtures had a surplus of 449 g m −2 y −1 in 2006 and 492 g m −2 y −1 in 2007 over the monoculture yields whereas the high-input management resulted in only 315 g m −2 y −1 higher productivity in 2006 and 440 g m −2 y −1 in 2007 than the low-input management. In addition, high-diversity low-input grassland communities had similar productivity as low-diversity high-input commu-nities. The slopes of the biodiversity – productivity relation-ships significantly increased with increasing levels of man-agement intensity in both years. We conclude that the biological mechanisms leading to enhanced biomass production in diverse grassland commu-nities are as effective for productivity as a combination of several agricultural measures. Our results demonstrate that high-diversity low-input grassland communities provide not Correspondence to: A. Weigelt (alexandra.weigelt@uni-jena.de) only a high diversity of plants and other organisms, but also ensure high forage yields, thus granting the basis for multi-functional managed grasslands.},

abstract = {Tree diversity in forests is an important driver of ecological processes including herbivory. Empirical evidence suggests both negative and positive effects of tree diversity on herbivory, which can be, respectively, attributed to associational resistance or associational susceptibility. Tree diversity experiments allow testing for associational effects, but evidence regarding which pattern predominates is mixed. Furthermore, it is unknown if herbivory on tree species of native vs. exotic origin is influenced by changing tree diversity in a similar way, or if exotic tree species escape natural enemies, resulting in lower damage that is unrelated to tree diversity. To address these questions, we established a young tree diversity experiment in temperate southwestern Germany that uses high planting density (49 trees per plot; plot size 13 m2). The species pool consists of six congeneric species pairs of European and North American origin (12 species in total) planted in monocultures and mixtures (1, 2, 4, 6 species). We assessed leaf damage by leaf-chewing insects on more than 5,000 saplings of six broadleaved tree species. Plot-level tree species richness increased leaf damage, which more than doubled from monocultures to six-species mixtures, strongly supporting associational susceptibility. However, leaf damage among congeneric native and exotic species pairs was similar. There were marked differences in patterns of leaf damage across tree genera, and only the genera likely having a predominately generalist herbivore community showed associational susceptibility, irrespective of the geographical origin of a tree species. In conclusion, an increase in tree species richness in young temperate forests may result in associational susceptibility to feeding by generalist herbivores.},

abstract = {Over the past decade an increasing number of studies have experimentally manipulated the number of species in a community and examined how this alters the aggregate production of species biomass. Many of these studies have shown that the effects of richness on biomass change through time, but we have limited understanding of the mechanisms that produce these dynamic trends. Here we report the results of an experiment in which we manipulated the richness of freshwater algae in laboratory microcosms. We used two experimental designs (additive and substitutive) that make different assumptions about how patches are initially colonized, and then tracked the development of community biomass from the point of initial colonization through a period of 6–12 generations of the focal species. We found that the effect of initial species richness on biomass production qualitatively shifted twice over the course of the experiment. The first shift occurred as species transitioned from density-independent to dependent phases of population growth. At this time, intraspecific competition caused monocultures to approach their respective carrying capacities more slowly than polycultures. As a consequence, species tended to over-yield for a brief time, generating a positive, but transient effect of diversity on community biomass. The second shift occurred as communities approached carrying capacity. At this time, strong interspecific interactions caused biomass to be dominated by the competitively superior species in polycultures. As this species had the lowest carrying capacity, a negative effect of diversity on biomass resulted in late succession. Although these two shifts produced dynamics that appeared complex, we show that the patterns can be fit to a simple Lotka-Volterra model of competition. Our results suggest that the effects of algal diversity on primary production change in a predictable sequence through successional time.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, a large number of studies have investigated the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, most of which focussed on a limited set of ecosystem variables. The Jena Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for functional biodiversity research. First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an ecosystem. About 45% of different types of ecosystem processes measured in the ‘main experiment', where plant species richness ranged from 1 to 60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness, providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This highlights the need to revisit diversity–stability theory. Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not instead of, effects of plant species richness. Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was stronger for above- than for belowground organisms, and stronger for herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger than the effect on species abundances. Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g. carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant species richness than variables of the C cycle. Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment, most investigated plant traits, both above- and belowground, were plastic and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way, suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits to particular functions. Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments, supported the important role of the biotic component for element and water fluxes. Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency. Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that diverse ‘High Nature Value Grasslands' are multifunctional and can deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related services. A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the effort (in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments. To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake. Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible.},

abstract = {Plants furnish soil with organic carbon (OC) compounds that fuel soil microorganisms, but whether individual plant species – or plants with unique traits – do so uniquely is uncertain. We evaluated soil microbial processes within a wetland in which areas dominated by a distinct plant species (cattail –Typha sp.; purple loosestrife –Lythrum salicaria L.; reed canarygrass –Phalaris arundinacea L.) co-mingled. We also established an experimental plot with plant shoot removal. The Phalaris area had more acidic soil pH (7.08 vs. 7.27–7.57), greater amount of soil organic matter (19.0% vs. 9.0–11.5%), and the slowest production rates of CO2 (0.10 vs. 0.21–0.46 $\mu$mol kg−1 s−1) and CH4 (0.040 vs. 0.054–0.079 nmol kg−1 s−1). Nitrogen cycling was dominated by net nitrification, with similar rates (17.2–18.9 mg kg−1 14 days−1) among the four sampling areas. In the second part of the study, we emplaced soil cores that either allowed root in-growth or excluded roots to evaluate how roots directly affect soil CO2 and CH4. The three plant species had similar amounts of root growth (ca 290 g m−2 year−1). Fungal biomass was similar in soils with root in-growth versus root exclusion, regardless of dominant plant species. Rates of soil CO2 production did not differ with root in-growth versus root exclusion, and added glucose increased CO2 production rates by only 35%. Root in-growth did lead to greater rates of CH4 production; albeit, addition of glucose had much greater effect on CH4 production (1.24 nmol kg−1 s−1) compared with controls without added glucose (0.058 nmol kg−1 s−1). Our data revealed relatively few subtle differences in soil characteristics and processes associated with different plant species; albeit, roots had little effect, even inhibiting some microbial processes. This research highlights the need for both field and experimental studies in long-established monocultures of plant species to understand the role of plant biodiversity in soil function.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The functioning of ecosystems results from the interplay between living organisms and their surroundings. Therefore, our ability to predict ecosystem functioning depends on our understanding of interactions between dynamic biotic and abiotic variables. Biodiversity can be influenced by the changes in the environment and can also influence ecosystem functioning, but our understanding of how environmental changes influence biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships remains limited. In coastal marine systems, water flow is a crucial determinant of resource delivery for sessile suspension-feeding animals and can potentially influence secondary production and the rate at which suspended materials are removed from water, determining water clarity, light penetration, and other key abiotic variables. We experimentally investigated how the presence and absence of water flow influenced phytoplankton consumption by suspension-feeder communities of varying species richness and composition. Consumer species richness enhanced filtration to the same degree in both flow conditions, despite generally decreased filtration in flow and considerable variation in the response to flow by consumers in monoculture. Species pairs filtered more than expected from monoculture performance, and species traits helped explain variance in these trends. However, there was no evidence of prey size selectivity by any consumer species, ruling this out as a mechanism underlying diversity effects. Our finding that the shape of the relationship between biodiversity and water filtration was identical in both flow conditions suggests that complementarity in this system is robust to at least one type of environmental variation.},

abstract = {The prediction of pest-control functioning by multi-predator communities is hindered by the non-additive nature of species functioning. Such non-additivity, commonly termed an emergent multi-predator effect, is known to be affected by elements of the ecological context, such as the structure and composition of vegetation, in addition to the traits of the predators themselves. Here we report mesocosm experiments designed to test the influence of plant density and species composition (wheat monoculture or wheat and faba bean polyculture) on the emergence of multi-predator effects between Adalia bipunctata and Chrysoperla carnea, in their suppression of populations of the aphid Metopolophium dirhodum. The mesocosm experiments were followed by a series of behavioural observations designed to identify how interactions among predators are modified by plant species composition and whether these effects are consistent with the observed influence of plant species composition on aphid population suppression. Although plant density was shown to have no influence on the multi-predator effect on aphid population growth, plant composition had a marked effect. In wheat monoculture, Adalia and Chrysoperla mixed treatments caused greater suppression of M. dirhodum populations than expected. However this positive emergent effect was reversed to a negative multi-predator effect in wheat and faba bean polyculture. The behavioural observations revealed that although dominant individuals did not respond to the presence of faba bean plants, the behaviour of sub-dominants was affected markedly, consistent with their foraging for extra-floral nectar produced by the faba bean. This interaction between plant composition and predator community composition on the foraging behaviour of sub-dominants is thought to underlie the observed effect of plant composition on the multi-predator effect. Thus, the emergence of multi-predator effects is shown to be strongly influenced by plant species composition, mediated, in this case, by the provision of extra-floral nectar by one of the plant species.},

Variation in biomass across years (CV) was 50% lower in mixtures than monocultures of both native and exotic species. Growth among species was more asynchronous and overyielding values were greater during and after a drought in native than exotic mixtures. Mean-variance slopes indicated strong portfolio effects in both community types, but the intercept was higher for exotics than for natives, suggesting that exotics were inherently more variable than native species. However, this failed to result in higher CV's in exotic communities because species that heavily dominated plots tended to have lower than expected variance.

abstract = {In many systems, native communities are being replaced by novel exotic-dominated ones. We experimentally compared species diversity decline between nine-species grassland communities under field conditions to test whether diversity maintenance mechanisms differed between communities containing all exotic or all native species using a pool of 40 species. Aboveground biomass was greater in exotic than native plots, and this difference was larger in mixtures than in monocultures. Species diversity declined more in exotic than native communities and declines were explained by different mechanisms. In exotic communities, overyielding species had high biomass in monoculture and diversity declined linearly as this selection effect increased. In native communities, however, overyielding species had low biomass in monoculture and there was no relationship between the selection effect and diversity decline. This suggests that, for this system, yielding behaviour is fundamentally different between presumably co-evolved natives and coevolutionarily naive exotic species, and that native-exotic status is important to consider.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have examined relationships between primary production and biodiversity at higher trophic levels. However, altered production in plant communities is often tightly linked with concomitant shifts in diversity and composition, and most studies have not disentangled the direct effects of production on consumers. Furthermore, when studies do examine the effects of plant production on animals in terrestrial systems, they are primarily confined to a subset of taxonomic or functional groups instead of investigating the responses of the entire community. Using natural monocultures of the salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, we were able to examine the impacts of increased plant production, independent of changes in plant composition and/or diversity, on the trophic structure, composition, and diversity of the entire arthropod community. If arthropod species richness increased with greater plant production, we predicted that it would be driven by: (1) an increase in the number of rare species, and/or (2) an increase in arthropod abundance. Our results largely supported our predictions: species richness of herbivores, detritivores, predators, and parasitoids increased monotonically with increasing levels of plant production, and the diversity of rare species also increased with plant production. However, rare species that accounted for this difference were predators, parasitoids, and detritivores, not herbivores. Herbivore species richness could be simply explained by the relationship between abundance and diversity. Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), we also found significant changes in arthropod species composition with increasing levels of production. Our findings have important implications in the intertidal salt marsh, where human activities have increased nitrogen runoff into the marsh, and demonstrate that such nitrogen inputs cascade to affect community structure, diversity, and abundance in higher trophic levels.},

abstract = {Consumer diversity effects on ecosystem functioning are highly context dependent and are determined by consumer specialization and other consumer and prey specific traits such as growth and grazing rates. Despite complex reciprocal interactions between consumers and their prey, few experimental studies have focused on prey diversity effects on consumer dynamics and trophic transfer. In microbial microcosms, we investigated effects of algal prey diversity (one, two and four species) on the production, evenness and grazing rates of 4 ciliate consumers, differing in grazing preferences and rates. Prey diversity increased prey biovolume in the absence of consumers and had opposing effects on different consumers, depending on their specialization and their preferred prey. Consumers profited from prey mixtures compared to monocultures of non-preferred prey, but responded negatively if preferred prey species were offered together with other species. Prey diversity increased consumer evenness by preventing dominance of specific consumers, demonstrating that the loss of prey species may have cascading effects resulting in reduced consumer diversity. Our study emphasizes that not only the degree of specialization but also the selectivity for certain prey species within the dietary niche may alter the consequences of changing prey diversity in a food web context.},

abstract = {Observational studies and experimental evidence agree that rising global temperatures have altered plant phenology-the timing of life events, such as flowering, germination, and leaf-out. Other large-scale global environmental changes, such as nitrogen deposition and altered precipitation regimes, have also been linked to changes in flowering times. Despite our increased understanding of how abiotic factors influence plant phenology, we know very little about how biotic interactions can affect flowering times, a significant knowledge gap given ongoing human-caused alteration of biodiversity and plant community structure at the global scale. We experimentally manipulated plant diversity in a California serpentine grassland and found that many plant species flowered earlier in response to reductions in diversity, with peak flowering date advancing an average of 0.6 days per species lost. These changes in phenology were mediated by the effects of plant diversity on soil surface temperature, available soil N, and soil moisture. Peak flowering dates were also more dispersed among species in high-diversity plots than expected based on monocultures. Our findings illustrate that shifts in plant species composition and diversity can alter the timing and distribution of flowering events, and that these changes to phenology are similar in magnitude to effects induced by climate change. Declining diversity could thus contribute to or exacerbate phenological changes attributed to rising global temperatures.},

abstract = {A major frontier in global change research is predicting how multiple agents of global change will alter plant productivity, a critical component of the carbon cycle. Recent research has shown that plant responses to climate change are phylogenetically conserved such that species within some lineages are more productive than those within other lineages in changing environments. However, it remains unclear how phylogenetic patterns in plant responses to changing abiotic conditions may be altered by another agent of global change, the introduction of non-native species. Using a system of 28 native Tasmanian Eucalyptus species belonging to two subgenera, Symphyomyrtus and Eucalyptus, we hypothesized that productivity responses to abiotic agents of global change (elevated CO2 and increased soil N) are unique to lineages, but that novel interactions with a non-native species mediate these responses. We tested this hypothesis by examining productivity of 1) native species monocultures and 2) mixtures of native species with an introduced hardwood plantation species, Eucalyptus nitens, to experimentally manipulated soil N and atmospheric CO2. Consistent with past research, we found that N limits productivity overall, especially in elevated CO2 conditions. However, monocultures of species within the Symphyomyrtus subgenus showed the strongest response to N (gained 127% more total biomass) in elevated CO2 conditions, whereas those within the Eucalyptus subgenus did not respond to N. Root:shoot ratio (an indicator of resource use) was on average greater in species pairs containing Symphyomyrtus species, suggesting that functional traits important for resource uptake are phylogenetically conserved and explaining the phylogenetic pattern in plant response to changing environmental conditions. Yet, native species mixtures with E. nitens exhibited responses to CO2 and N that differed from those of monocultures, supporting our hypothesis and highlighting that both plant evolutionary history and introduced species will shape community productivity in a changing world.},

abstract = {For centuries, traditional agricultural systems have contributed to food and livelihood security throughout the world. Recognizing the ecological legacy in the traditional agricultural systems may help us develop novel sustainable agriculture. We examine how rice-fish coculture (RF), which has been designated a "globally important agricultural heritage system," has been maintained for over 1,200 y in south China. A field survey demonstrated that although rice yield and rice-yield stability are similar in RF and rice monoculture (RM), RF requires 68% less pesticide and 24% less chemical fertilizer than RM. A field experiment confirmed this result. We documented that a mutually beneficial relationship between rice and fish develops in RF: Fish reduce rice pests and rice favors fish by moderating the water environment. This positive relationship between rice and fish reduces the need for pesticides in RF. Our results also indicate a complementary use of nitrogen (N) between rice and fish in RF, resulting in low N fertilizer application and low N release into the environment. These findings provide unique insights into how positive interactions and complementary use of resource between species generate emergent ecosystem properties and how modern agricultural systems might be improved by exploiting synergies between species.},

This concept has been adopted to integrated pest management in organic crop production to conserve natural enemies. However, trials are needed to find an appropriate cropping regime and the coincided field management for a specific crop and the dynamic relations of the pests and natural enemies under the conservation practices need to be clarified. Therefore, in the present study, with a relay-intercropping regime as a strategy to enrich field vegetation diversity and habitat improvement by plant residual mulching as a strategy to enrich field fauna diversity, a cabbage crop experiment was conducted to monitor the population dynamics of pests and native natural enemies and to confirm the effectiveness of relay-intercropping and plant residual mulching in natural enemies conservation and the consequent biological pest control. A summer cabbage was intercropped with tomato, and plant residues were mulched on the soil surface as the habitat for natural enemies. During the growth period of crops, the density of Lepidoptera larvae and three kind of predators including frog, spider and carabid were examined and analyzed with mathematic model as P 1 = P B1 + {P max -P B1 -P Y1 [1-$\beta$ 1 (t-$\tau$) 2 ]}EXP[-$\alpha$ 1 (t-$\tau$) 2 ] +P Y1 [1-$\beta$ 1 (t-$\tau$)2] (t ≤$\tau$) and P 2 = P B2 +{P max -P B2 -P Y2 [1-$\beta$ 2 (t-$\tau$) 2 ]}EXP [-$\alpha$ 2 (t-$\tau$) 2 ]+P Y2 [1-$\beta$ 2 (t-$\tau$) 2 ] (t≥$\tau$). The density of pests was lower in intercropping plots than in mono-cultured plots and lower in plots with habitat management than in those without. The density of natural enemies was higher in intercropping plots than in mono-cultured plots and higher in plots with habitat management than in those without. The damage index of cabbage and tomato was proportional to population density of pests. It was concluded that tomato as a shelter crop lowered the risk of pest incidence in the intercropped cabbage crop and residual mulching as habitat management in the crop field could favour natural enemies to control pest insects.},

abstract = {The idea that plant communities with high species diversity are more stable, productive, and resistant to invasion at small spatial scales has become an important ecological paradigm. Recently, the role of soil biota has emerged as a major driver of this relationship between plant species diversity and ecosystem function. In greenhouse experiments, we found that soil collected from experimentally constructed species-rich plant assemblages (that originally contained between 10 and 16 species) promoted the growth of 4 native target plant species more than soil from species-poor communities (that originally contained between 2 and 5 species). Sterilization of soils from species-poor communities improved the growth of these target species more than sterilization of soils from species-rich plant communities, indicative that inhibitory soil biota had greater negative impacts on plant growth in low versus high diversity soils. These results suggest that strong soil biota effects in soils do not simply accrue in experimental monocultures, but can occur in low diversity assemblages that are more realistic of what occurs in nature. Our findings suggest a mechanistic explanation for the diversity–productivity relationship, and further support the importance of inhibitory soil biota as significant contributors to spatial and temporal patterns of abundance in natural plant communities through negative plant−soil feedback.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intercropping systems could increase crop diversity and avoid vulnerability to biotic stresses. Most studies have shown that intercropping can provide relief to crops against wind-dispersed pathogens. However, there was limited data on how the practice of intercropping help crops against soil-borne Phytophthora disease.\n\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to pepper monoculture, a large scale intercropping study of maize grown between pepper rows reduced disease levels of the soil-borne pepper Phytophthora blight. These reduced disease levels of Phytophthora in the intercropping system were correlated with the ability of maize plants to form a "root wall" that restricted the movement of Phytophthora capsici across rows. Experimentally, it was found that maize roots attracted the zoospores of P. capsici and then inhibited their growth. When maize plants were grown in close proximity to each other, the roots produced and secreted larger quantities of 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA) and 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (MBOA). Furthermore, MBOA, benzothiazole (BZO), and 2-(methylthio)-benzothiazole (MBZO) were identified in root exudates of maize and showed antimicrobial activity against P. capsici.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Maize could form a "root wall" to restrict the spread of P. capsici across rows in maize and pepper intercropping systems. Antimicrobe compounds secreted by maize root were one of the factors that resulted in the inhibition of P. capsici. These results provide new insights into plant-plant-microbe mechanisms involved in intercropping systems.},

Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), BIOLOG profiles of soil microbes and soil enzyme activities were measured. Under monoculture, elevated Pb did not reduce soil MBC, had no effects on activities of urease, acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase, but stimulated the activity of alkaline phosphatase. Compared to monoculture, plant species coexistence did not significantly affect soil microbial biomass C but increased microbial functional group diversity index and urease activity under different Pb concentrations. In addition, microbial community structure diverged among plant coexistence treatments under each Pb concentration. These results suggested that coexistence of plant species might alleviate the effects of metal lead on soil microbes and reducing metal lead effect on urease activity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Plant community functional composition can be manipulated in restored ecosystems to reduce the establishment potential of invading species. This study was designed to compare invasion resistance among communities with species functionally similar or dissimilar to yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), a late-season annual. A field experiment was conducted in the Central Valley of California with six experimental plant communities that included (1) six early-season native annual forbs (AF); (2) five late-season native perennials and one summer annual forb (NP); (3) a combination of three early-season native annual forbs and three late-season native perennials (FP); (4) six early-season non-native annual grasses (AG); (5) monoculture of the late-season native perennial grass Elymus glaucus (EG); and (6) monoculture of the late-season native perennial Grindelia camporum (GC). Following establishment, C. solstitialis seed was added to half of the plots, and a monoculture of C. solstitialis (CS) was established as a control. Over a 5-year period, the AF and AG communities were ineffective at preventing C. solstitialis invasion. Centaurea solstitialis cover remained less than 10% in the FP and NP communities, except in year 1. By the fourth year, E. glaucus cover was greater than 50% in NP and FP communities and had spread to all other communities (e.g., 27% cover in CS in year 5). Communities containing E. glaucus, which is functionally similar to C. solstitialis, better resisted invasion than communities lacking a functional analog. In contrast, G. camporum, which is also functionally similar to C. solstitialis, failed to survive. Consequently, species selection for restored communities must consider not only functional similarity to the invader but also establishment success, competitiveness, and survivorship.},

abstract = {Many tropical plantations in Central America are monocultures of fast growing, mostly exotic species such as a teak, eucalypts and pines. This has been perceived as a problem for ecosystem stability, pest control, local biodiversity and long-term nutrient availability. In our study, we followed the effects of increasing tree diversity (1, 3 and 6 native species) on aboveground nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pools in a young experimental biodiversity plantation (central Panama) over two subsequent years. Our results show a positive but not consistent net effect of biodiversity on the N and P pools, mainly explained by the complementarity effect. N and P use efficiencies strongly varied among the investigated tree species and the species richness gradient. Anacardium excelsum and Luehea seemannii were associated with higher N and P use efficiencies while Hura crepitans and Tabebuia rosea were less efficient in aboveground biomass production per unit N or P. Tree species tended to have lower P use efficiencies in the intermediate diversity level compared to monocultures and six-species mixtures. Although the environmental conditions explained a large part of the variation in the N and P pools (58%) in our experiment, we argue that incorporating tree mixtures in the management can bring additional benefits and improve tree growth and nutrient uptake as compared to the monocultures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Besides crops, agriculture supplies all three major categories of ecosystem services (ES). However, agriculture also supplies an array of ecosystem dis-services (EDS) that may harm other ecosystems. The flows of ES and EDS are directly dependent on the management of agricultural ecosystems. The traditional method of Chinese agriculture, which supports sustainable agriculture, has been proven to increase ES and reduce EDS. However, there is a lack of a detailed understanding of the ES and EDS associated with traditional agriculture, and also of differences between traditional and modern agriculture. In this study, an investigation was conducted on the ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem dis-services (EDS) of traditional and modern agriculture in Congjiang County, Guizhou Province, China. Afterwards, the economic values of ES and EDS were quantified experimentally and calculated based on the market price. The results show that: the net economic value of traditional rice-fish agriculture was 3.31×10 4 CNY{\textperiodcentered}ha -1 (6.83 CNY = 1 USD as of July, 2009) and that of rice monoculture was 1.99×10 4 CNY{\textperiodcentered}ha -1. Significant differences existed between traditional rice-fish and rice monoculture fields for their economic values of some ES or EDS. A benefit and cost analysis (BCA) model was used to adjust the conflict between the economic income and environmental loss from traditional and modern agriculture. The BCA model not only calculates the net income but also monetizes the EDS of the agricultural systems. The results showed that the net income of rice-fish agriculture was 1.94×10 4 CNY{\textperiodcentered}ha -1 higher than that of rice monoculture. However, the benefit to cost ratio (BCR) of rice-fish agriculture was lower than that of rice monoculture, indicating that the traditional agricultural model was not the most optimized choice for farmers. The value of the rice-fish agriculture was much higher than that of the rice monoculture. Thus, when considering the benefits that rice-fish agriculture contributes to the largescale society, these agricultural methods needs to be utilized. Furthermore, the labor opportunity costs were calculated and the comprehensive value of rice monoculture was negative. Finally, the compensation standard was calculated based on the comprehensive benefit analysis. The lowest level was 1.09×10 3 CNY{\textperiodcentered}ha -1, and the highest level was 1.21×10 4 CNY{\textperiodcentered}ha -1. {\textcopyright} 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Rice-duck farming is one of the traditional, but current and gradually popularized, ecological farming techniques for paddy rice production in China. In comparison to rice monoculture farming, we investigated a weed community and weed infestation in a transplanted rice-duck farming system and examined the effects of duck activities on the weeds. Three treatments were imposed in the experiment: a rice-duck coculture with duck grazing and disturbance effects, a rice-duck coculture with duck disturbance effects only, and a control (rice monoculture, no duck effects). Rice seedlings were nursed and transplanted in this experiment. The total number of weed species was significantly lower in the treatment with both duck grazing and disturbance and in the treatment with duck disturbance only than in the monoculture rice treatment (control). The Shannon-Wiener Biodiversity Index of the weed species decreased but the Pielou Evenness Index increased in both treatments with ducks compared to the monoculture control. Sorensen's coefficient of similarity of the weed communities was low between the treatments with ducks and the monoculture control, implying that the weed communities diverged. The total density and biomass of the weed community in both the treatments with ducks were significantly lower compared to the monoculture control. However, compared to the rice monoculture control, the weed biomass was reduced by 98% in the treatment with duck grazing and disturbance and by 84% in the treatment with duck disturbance only, implying that only 14% of the weeds were controlled by duck grazing and that 84% of the weed biomass was inhibited by duck activities in the rice field with ducks. The rice grain yield increased in the treatments with ducks compared to the control. The results suggested that duck activities, like grazing weeds and disturbance of the soil and water, had a significant effect on the weed community structure and that weeds could be well controlled without herbicide application under a rice-duck farming system.},

abstract = {Species extinction and immigration are both common in natural communities and the sequence with which species are lost from or added to communities may be crucial to community structure. We experimentally addressed this issue by growing six green algal species in monocultures and all possible two-species mixtures, with two colonization sequences for each mixture. Both convergence and divergence in community structure were observed. The compositions containing particularly productive species were more likely to converge, while those comprising of species with similar monoculture yields were more likely to diverge. The species mixtures with high-yielding initial and low-yielding invading species produced more biomass than monocultures, but mixtures with the opposite assembly order produced only the same level of biomass as monocultures did. To address the diversity ecosystem functioning issue, we estimate complementarity effect by relative yield total (RYT) and selection effect by the correlation between species' monoculture yields and their relative yields in mixtures, respectively. We found overall negative complementarity and positive selection effect in mixtures with high-yielding species as initial colonizers, but positive complementarity and negative selection effect in mixtures with low-yielding initial species. Nonetheless, because we used only up to two species in each microcosm, our results are limited in addressing the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Future research should study the effects of immigration history with many more species involved in community assembly.},

abstract = {The importance of species richness for ecosystem productivity has received much attention in recent years, but the consequences of non-random species extinction remain poorly understood. We propose an index, 'essentiality', to assess the consequence of extinction of particular species for community biomass production. The essentiality of a species in a given community is the extent to which the functional role of that species is irreplaceable by the remaining species, calculated as the relative difference in yields between communities with and without the focal species. Species with zero essentiality play a completely replaceable functional role in their communities. Positive essentialities suggest irreplaceable contributions by species to their communities; species with essentiality values even higher than their dominance in the community may exhibit facilitative effects on the other species. Negative essentialities indicate interference of the focal species with other members of the same community. We applied this index to data from a microcosm experiment, in which five algal species were grown in monocultures and in all possible species combinations. Essentiality varied greatly across species. Two species had overall zero essentiality values throughout the experiment, two species had positive essentiality values which were lower than the species' dominance, and the remaining species had negative essentiality. Furthermore, two out of the five species had essentiality values dependent on species richness of communities from which they were lost; essentiality decreased with an increase in species richness. The essentiality index provides a straightforward measurement of functional consequences of individual species loss, which complements the existing analytical methods by focusing on the detection of facilitation and interference. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {1. Although there is ample support for positive species richness–productivity relationships in planted grassland experiments, a recent 48-site study found no diversity–productivity relationship (DPR) in herbaceous communities. Thus, debate persists about diversity effects in natural versus planted systems. Additionally, current knowledge is weak regarding the influence of evenness on theDPRs, howDPRs are affected by the variation in life-history traitsamong constituent species in polycultures and how DPRs differ among biomes. The impacts of these factors on DPRs in forest ecosystems are evenmore poorly understood. 2. We performed a meta-analysis of 54 studies to reconcile DPRs in forest ecosystems. We quanti- fied the net diversity effect as log effect size [ln(ES)], the log ratio of the productivity in polycultures to the average of those in monocultures within the same type of mixture, site condition and stand age of each study. The first use of a boosted regression treemodel in meta-analysis, a useful method to partition the effects of multiple predictors rather than relying on vote-counting of individual studies, unveiled the relative influences of individual predictors. 3. Global average ln(ES) was 0.2128, indicating 23.7% higher productivity in polycultures than monocultures. The final model explained 21%of the variation in ln(ES). The predictors that sub- stantially accounted for the explained variation included evenness (34%), heterogeneity of shade tolerance (29%), richness (13%) and stand age (15%). In contrast, heterogeneity of nitrogen fixa- tion and growth habits, biome and stand origin (naturally established versus planted) contributed negligibly (each {\pounds}4%). Log effect size strongly increased with evenness from0.6 to 1 and with rich- ness from 2 to 6. Furthermore, it was higher with heterogeneity of shade tolerance and generally increasedwith stand age. 4. Synthesis. Our analysis is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the critical role of species evenness, richness and the importance of contrasting traits in defining net diversity effects in forest polycultures. While testing the specific mechanisms is beyond the scope of our analysis, our results should motivate future studies to link richness, evenness, contrasting traits and life-history stage to the mechanisms that are expected to produce positive net biodiversity effects such as niche differen- tiation, facilitation and reduced Janzen–Connell effects.},

abstract = {Because the frequency of heterospecific interactions inevitably increases with species richness in a community, biodiversity effects must be expressed by such interactions. However, little is understood how heterospecific interactions affect ecosystem productivity because rarely are biodiversity ecosystem functioning experiments spatially explicitly manipulated. To test the effect of heterospecific interactions on productivity, direct evidence of heterospecific neighborhood interaction is needed. In this study we conducted experiments with a detailed spatial design to investigate whether and how heterospecific neighborhood interactions promote primary productivity in a grassland community. The results showed that increasing the heterospecific: conspecific contact ratio significantly increased productivity. We found there was a significant difference in the variation in plant height between monoculture and mixture communities, suggesting that height-asymmetric competition for light plays a central role in promoting productivity. Heterospecific interactions make tall plants grow taller and short plants become smaller in mixtures compared to monocultures, thereby increasing the efficiency of light interception and utilization. Overyielding in the mixture communities arises from the fact that the loss in the growth of short plants is compensated by the increased growth of tall plants. The positive correlation between species richness and primary production was strengthened by increasing the frequency of heterospecific interactions. We conclude that species richness significantly promotes primary ecosystem production through heterospecific neighborhood interactions.},

abstract = {Ecological interactions between aboveground and belowground biodiversity have received many attentions in the recent decades. Although soil biodiversity declined with the decrease of plant diversity, many previous studies found plant species identities were more important than plant diversity in controlling soil biodiversity. This study focused on the responses of soil biodiversity to the altering of plant functional groups, namely overstory and understory vegetations, rather than plant diversity gradient. We conducted an experiment by removing overstory and/or understory vegetation to compare their effects on soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and nematode diversities in eucalyptus monocultures. Our results indicated that both overstory and understory vegetations could affect soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities, which manifested as the decrease in Shannon–Wiener diversity index (H′) and Pielou evenness index (J) and the increase in Simpson dominance index ($\lambda$) after vegetation removal. Soil microclimate change explained part of variance of soil biodiversity indices. Both overstory and understory vegetations positively correlated with soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities. In addition, the alteration of soil biodiversity might be due to a mixing effect of bottom-up control and soil microclimate change after vegetation removal in the studied plantations. Given the studied ecosystem is common in humid subtropical and tropical region of the world, our findings might have great potential to extrapolate to large scales and could be conducive to ecosystem management and service.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although plant diversity is postulated to resist invasion, studies have not provided consistent results, most of which were ascribed to the influences of other covariate environmental factors. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To explore the mechanisms by which plant diversity influences community invasibility, an experiment was conducted involving grassland sites varying in their species richness (one, two, four, eight, and sixteen species). Light interception efficiency and soil resources (total N, total P, and water content) were measured. The number of species, biomass, and the number of seedlings of the invading species decreased significantly with species richness. The presence of Patrinia scabiosaefolia Fisch. ex Trev. and Mosla dianthera (Buch.-Ham. ex Roxburgh) Maxim. significantly increased the resistance of the communities to invasion. A structural equation model showed that the richness of planted species had no direct and significant effect on invasion. Light interception efficiency had a negative effect on the invasion whereas soil water content had a positive effect. In monocultures, Antenoron filiforme (Thunb.) Rob. et Vaut. showed the highest light interception efficiency and P. scabiosaefolia recorded the lowest soil water content. With increased planted-species richness, a greater percentage of pots showed light use efficiency higher than that of A. filiforme and a lower soil water content than that in P. scabiosaefolia. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study suggest that plant diversity confers resistance to invasion, which is mainly ascribed to the sampling effect of particular species and the complementarity effect among species on resources use.},

abstract = {Most biodiversity experiments have been conducted in grassland ecosystems with nitrogen limitation, while little research has been conducted on relationships between plant biomass production, substrate nitrogen retention and plant diversity in wetlands with continuous nitrogen supply. We conducted a plant diversity experiment in a subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland for treating domestic wastewater in southeastern China. Plant aboveground biomass production ranged from 20 to 3121gm-2yr-1across all plant communities. In general, plant biomass production was positively correlated with species richness (P=0.001) and functional group richness (P=0.001). Substrate nitrate concentration increased significantly with increasing plant species richness (P=0.046), but not with functional group richness (P=0.550). Furthermore, legumes did not affect biomass production (P=0.255), retention of substrate nitrate (P=0.280) and ammonium (P=0.269). Compared to the most productive of the corresponding monocultures, transgressive overyielding of mixed plant communities did not occur in most polycultures. Because greater diversity of plant community led to higher biomass production and substrate nitrogen retention, thus we recommend that plant biodiversity should be incorporated in constructed wetlands to improve wastewater treatment efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Farms in the glaciated tallgrass prairie region of North America are topographically heterogeneous with wide-ranging soil quality. This environmental heterogeneity may affect choice and placement of species planted for biomass production. We designed replicated experiments and monitored farm-scale production to evaluate the effects of landscape position, vegetation type, and year on yields of monocultures and mixtures. Research was conducted on a 262-ha South Dakota working farm where cropland had been replanted with a variety of native grassland types having biofuel feedstock potential. Vegetation type (diverse mixture or switchgrass [Panicum virgatum L.] monoculture) and year interacted to influence yield in replicated experiments (p<0.10). Mean annual switchgrass yield above a stubble height of 10cm was 9.3Mgha-1 in two replicated experiments, and was greater than yield of mixtures (7.3Mgha-1) in 6 of 7 year??vegetation type combinations. Landscape position interacted with year and vegetation type to influence yield (p<0.10). Variability was generally greatest at the lowest landscape position. On the farm's larger fields (0.4-46ha), three-year mean yields of switchgrass monocultures cut at ground level (12.7Mgha-1) were also greater than yields of mixtures (9.7Mgha-1) but both were less than prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) monoculture yield (13.2Mgha-1) in a restored wetland. A combination of prairie monocultures and mixtures, strategically placed across a farm landscape, could offer a balance of productivity, ecosystem services, and income with potential as biofuel feedstock and other income streams (hay, seed, beef). ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Aims In grassland biodiversity experiments, positive biodiversity effects on primary productivity increase over time. Recent research has shown that differential selection in monoculture and mixed-species communities leads to the rapid emergence of monoculture and mixture types, adapted to their own biotic community. We used eight plant species selected for 8 years in such a biodiversity experiment to test if monoculture and mixture types differed in metabolic profiles using infrared spectroscopy.Methods Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to assess metabolic fingerprints of leaf samples of 10 individuals of each species from either monocultures or mixtures. The FTIR spectra were analyzed using multivariate procedures to assess (i) whether individuals within species could be correctly assigned to monoculture or mixture history based on the spectra alone and (ii) which parts of the spectra drive the group assignment, i.e. which metabolic groups were subject to differential selection in monocultures vs. mixtures.Important Findings Plant individuals within each of the eight species could be classified as either from monoculture or mixture selection history based on their FTIR spectra. Different metabolic groups were differentially selected in the different species; some of them may be related to defense of pathogens accumulating more strongly in monocultures than in mixtures. The rapid selection of the monoculture and mixture types within the eight study species could have been due to a sorting-out process based on large initial genetic or epigenetic variation within the species.},
