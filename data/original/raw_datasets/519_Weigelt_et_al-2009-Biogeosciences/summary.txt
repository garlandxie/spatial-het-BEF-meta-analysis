Abstract:	This data set contains a time series of plant height measurements (vegetative and reproductive) from the main experiment plots of a large grassland biodiversity experiment (the Jena Experiment; see further details below). In addition, data on species specific plant heights for the main experiment are available from 2002. In the main experiment, 82 grassland plots of 20 x 20 m were established from a pool of 60 species belonging to four functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall and small herbs). In May 2002, varying numbers of plant species from this species pool were sown into the plots to create a gradient of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 species) and functional richness (1, 2, 3, 4 functional groups). Plots were maintained by bi-annual weeding and mowing. 
	1. Plant height was recorded, generally, twice a year just before biomass harvest (during peak standing biomass in late May and in late August). Methodologies of measuring height have varied somewhat over the years. In earlier year the streched plant height was measured, while in later years the standing height without streching the plant was measured. Vegetative height was measured either as the height of the highest leaf or as the length of the main axis of non-flowering plants. Regenerating height was measured either as the height of the highest flower on a plant or as the height of the main axis of flowering. Sampled plants were either randomly selected in the core area of plots or along transects in defined distances. For details refer to the description of individual years. Starting in 2006, also the plots of the management experiment, that altered mowing frequency and fertilized subplots (see further details in the general description of the Jena Experiment) were sampled. 
	2. Species specific plant height was recorded two times in 2002: in late July (vegetative height) and just before biomass harvest during peak standing biomass in late August (vegetative and regenerative height). For each plot and each sown species in the species pool, 3 plant individuals (if present) from the central area of the plots were randomly selected and used to measure vegetative height (non-flowering indviduals) and regenerative height (flowering individuals) as stretched height. Provided are the means over the three measuremnts per plant species per plot.
